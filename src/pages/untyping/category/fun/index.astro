                      Running a startup is a lot of work. All manner of tasks
                      constantly compete for the team&#8217;s attention
                      mandating a careful dance to keep on top of everything. We
                      haven&#8217;t nailed all the footwork to this dance yet,
                      but we have learned that choosing the right tool for each
                      job can drastically simplify the choreography.

                      We recently rewrote a large portion of <a
                        href="http://mynaweb.com/"
                        >Myna</a
                      >
                      in the march towards version 2 of the platform. Most of
                      the customer-facing software - the dashboard, client
                      libraries, HTTP API, and so on - were completely new
                      and required new documentation. Our existing help pages
                      were in need of an overhaul, so we decided to move them
                      out into their own project using a build system based
                      on <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> and
                      <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The new documentation is still a work-in-progress -
                      you can watch its evolution <a
                        href="http://help.mynaweb.com/"
                        >on the Myna website</a
                      > and its <a href="http://github.com/myna/help"
                        >repository on Github</a
                      >
                      (yes, it&#8217;s open source - another experiment
                      we&#8217;re trying). We&#8217;re really happy with the way
                      it&#8217;s all working out, so we&#8217;ve <a
                        href="https://github.com/untyped/jekyll-docs"
                        >published the build system</a
                      > as a separate project that you can use to bootstrap your
                      own documentation. Go forth, fork, and profit!
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Why Jekyll?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                      Our old documentation was implemented as a set of
                      templates in the <a href="http://playframework.org/"
                        >Play 2</a
                      > web app that runs our marketing site and original
                      customer dashboard. Publishing the app requires a PhD in
                      SBT, Mongo and Redis, and if you&#8217;re writing
                      documentation on the train (as we are prone to do) it
                      isn&#8217;t uncommon to have your plans abruptly
                      terminated by one of SBT&#8217;s frequent unavoidable
                      urges to
                      <a
                        href="http://blog.sonatype.com/people/2011/04/how-not-to-download-the-internet/"
                        >download the whole internet</a
                      > (unadvisable in the middle of signal-free rural
                      England).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We considered moving to a CMS such as WordPress, but our
                      support team are all developers with their own preferred
                      editors and IDEs. Forcing them to write documentation
                      (painful) in a tiny WYSIWYG editor embedded into a web
                      site seemed like torture. Also, CMSs require internet
                      connections&#8230; it kinda goes with the territory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Grunt and Jekyll, in contrast, run completely offline, and
                      have a number of other advantages too. Plugins like
                      <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch"
                        >grunt-contrib-watch</a
                      >
                      provide instant previews via
                      <a href="http://livereload.com/">Livereload</a>,
                      and Jekyll&#8217;s syntax highlighting (provided by <a
                        href="http://pygments.org/"
                        >Pygments</a
                      >) can highlight any syntax you throw at it (including, to
                      my amazement, <a
                        href="http://help.mynaweb.com/api/experiment-create.html"
                        >HTTP</a
                      >).<br />
                      Jekyll isn&#8217;t completely perfect for the job. We had
                      to work around a few issues. Fortunately, none of them
                      proved insurmountable:
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Versioning</strong></p>
                    <p>
                      We&#8217;ve run into versioning problems many times
                      before, some requiring some
                      <a
                        href="http://planet.racket-lang.org/package-source/untyped/autoplanet.plt/1/2/planet-docs/autoplanet/index.html"
                        >pretty serious workarounds</a
                      >. In fact, versioning issues are pretty much endemic
                      across all software development platforms. In this
                      toolchain we&#8217;re relying on lots of components:
                      Grunt, five Grunt plugins, Ruby, and Jekyll. Fortunately,
                      versioning is pretty much a solved problem these days:
                      <a href="https://npmjs.org/">NPM</a> and
                      <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> are great package
                      managers for Node, and
                      <a href="http://bundler.io/">Bundler</a> normalizes not
                      only the version of Jekyll we&#8217;re using, but also the
                      version of Ruby itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong
                        >Static Assets (Say &#8220;NO&#8221; to Plain
                        CSS)</strong
                      >
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I may catch some flack for this, but CSS is a silly
                      language riddled with missing features and
                      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables/"
                        >bizarre design decisions</a
                      >. No way are we going to battle with a new documentation
                      project without tools like <a href="http://lesscss.org/"
                        >Less CSS</a
                      >
                      and
                      <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a
                      > to support us. And if we&#8217;re compiling and
                      minifying our CSS, we might do it for Javascript as
                      well. Jekyll doesn&#8217;t support support for either
                      process out-of-the-box.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      One way of solving these issues would be to use Jekyll
                      plugins - there are
                      <a href="https://github.com/zroger/jekyll-less">many</a>
                      <a href="https://github.com/moshen/jekyll-asset_bundler"
                        >candidates</a
                      > <a
                        href="http://matthodan.com/2012/11/22/jekyll-asset-pipeline.html"
                        >available</a
                      >
                      on Github. However, we prefer to use Grunt for this kind
                      of thing, running Jekyll via
                      <a href="https://github.com/jharding/grunt-exec"
                        >grunt-exec</a
                      > and <a href="http://bundler.io/">Bundler</a>, and using
                      <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch"
                        >grunt-contrib-watch</a
                      >
                      and
                      <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect"
                        >grunt-contrib-connect</a
                      >
                      for preview functionality.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Content Navigation</strong></p>
                    <p>
                      Jekyll has built-in support for
                      <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/"
                        >cataloguing and paginating blog posts</a
                      >, but it can&#8217;t natively generate navigation for a
                      hierarchical documentation site. Fortunately, this was
                      easy to work around with a couple of custom plugins:
                      <a
                        href="https://github.com/untyped/jekyll-docs/blob/master/jekyll_plugins/nav_toc.rb"
                        >one to create a table of contents</a
                      >
                      for the sidebar, and one to
                      <a
                        href="https://github.com/untyped/jekyll-docs/blob/master/jekyll_plugins/nav_pager.rb"
                        >generate next and previous buttons</a
                      >
                      at the bottom of each page.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Authenticating Users</strong></p>
                    <p>
                      The main navigation bar on Myna changes when users log in.
                      Ideally we want like to keep this consistent across the
                      main web site, the blog, and the documentation. Our
                      solution is to built a small Javascript app to monitor the
                      user&#8217;s login details and rewrite the navbar on
                      demand. This is a work-in-progress project and it&#8217;s
                      not part of the Github repo above.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
                    <p>

                      It’s Friday – time to kick back and relax with two fun
                      Scala programs we put together for your amusement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Scala has a pretty flexible syntax (although not as
                      flexible as <a
                        href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/scheme/pubs/scheme2007-ctf.pdf"
                        >Racket’s</a

                      of <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/1403">DSLs</a>.
                      Not all DSLs have to be serious, however, as I’m about to
                      prove.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      First up is Noel’s original concept – proof of his love
                      for DSLs, expressed in purest code:
                    </p>
                    <div>
                      <pre is:raw><code> class A(num: Int) { def Scala = "It's s" + ("o" * num) + " much fun!" } object I { def &lt;(num: Int) = new A(num) } I &lt;3 Scala // ==&gt; "It's sooo much fun!" </code></pre>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                      Second is a simpler work that I call “The Startled
                      Lolcat”:
                    </p>
                    <div>
                      <pre is:raw><code> object O { def o = "What has been seen, cannot be unseen." } O.o // ==&gt; "What has been seen, cannot be unseen."</code></pre>
                      <pre is:raw><code>
</code></pre>

                    <p>
                      I recently wrote a <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a
                      > plugin to do some smooth scrolling on the iPad, and I
                      thought I’d share the code with everyone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The effect you get is very similar to the iOS home screen.
                      The user touches the screen and drags to scroll. Releasing
                      the screen causes it to spring to the most appropriate
                      page based upon the last dragging position and speed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Gurus of front end development tell us that pretty much
                      the only way to get smooth transitions on the iPad is to
                      use 3D CSS transforms. After experimenting with jQuery
                      animations and 2D CSS transforms, I pretty much concur:
                      jQuery animations yield one or two frames per second, and
                      2D CSS transforms aren’t much better. 3D CSS transforms,
                      on the other hand, are hardware accelerated and smooth as
                      silk.

                      You can get the code from this <a

                        >Gist</a
                      > on Github (contributions and enhancements welcome). Use
                      it with the following HTML:
                    </p>
                    <div>
                      <pre is:raw><code> &lt;div id="viewport"&gt; &lt;div&gt;First page&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Second page&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Third page&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>
                    </div>
                    <p>and the following Javascript:</p>
                    <div>
                      <pre is:raw><code> $("#viewport").scrollpane(); </code></pre>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                      There’s a demo of it in action <a
                        href="http://boxandarrow.com/demos/ios-scroll/"
                        >here</a
                      >. A couple of notes:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Because this hooks into touch gesture events and CSS3 3D
                        transforms, it’ll pretty much only work on iDevices and
                        possibly other Webkit-based tablets.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        It works horizontally and vertically, but I’d recommend
                        only using it horizontally in a regular web page because
                        it interferes with Safari’s natural screen bounce. I had
                        the benefit of a working on an offline brochure where
                        the web page never scrolls naturally. In this
                        environment the plugin really shines. If you are
                        interested in doing something similar, take a look at
                        the iPad app <a
                          href="http://www.hiddenmemory.co.uk/delivery-site.html"
                          >Delivery Site</a
                        >, which lets you customise various things like this.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        There are a couple of options you can tweak to affect
                        things like dead-zones before a drag will trigger a page
                        transition. See the top of the source code for details.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        When the first 3D transform is added to a page, Mobile
                        Safari seems to transparently install an OpenGL panel to
                        handle the effects. This causes a rendering glitch
                        that’s just faintly visible if you’re paying attention.
                        The plugin works around this by setting an identity
                        transform on the scroll component on page load. Webkit
                        is presumably frugal about 3D-ification for a reason, so
                        you may find your web pages take more memory and CPU
                        resources with this plugin active than without.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Really large (read “many-page, full-screen”) scroll
                        panes can be very heavy on the browser. This is
                        presumably due to the overhead of creating a texture
                        buffer to 3D accelerate the transitions. I’ve managed
                        five-page full-screen scrolling transitions without
                        problems, but your mileage may vary.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>

                    <p>
                      Today is the closest and most interesting general election
                      in the UK that I can remember. This blog isn’t the place
                      to talk politics, but while reading the manifestos of the
                      three major parties I was struck by their design, and
                      particularly the design of their covers, and I’m going to
                      share some thoughts today on this topic. I think it’s
                      interesting to look at the message the each party is
                      trying to convey with their design and in particular how
                      they all, for me, got it wrong. In alphabetical order,
                      here they are:

                      Gold lettering on a blue cloth binding. I knew I’d seen
                      this before but it took a while before I remembered where:
                      my parent’s old textbooks, which I used to leaf through as
                      a child, had this kind of binding beneath their dust
                      jackets. I looked through all my and my wife’s textbooks
                      and didn’t find any the same. Add in the stuffy
                      “Invitation” and to me this says <em>old</em>. Very
                      traditional, very establishment, and very much at odds
                      with the image of David Cameron, with no tie and top
                      button undone, presented in the Tory advertising.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Labour</h2>
                    <div>

                        href="http://www.untyped.com/untyping/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/labour-manifesto-sml.png"

                    <p>
                      This is not a subtle cover. The illustration benefits from
                      the fact the UK is a small country and most places look
                      more or the less the same, so the patchwork fields will
                      look like “home” to almost everyone. I’m a bit surprised
                      the couple looks so white; I’d expect Labour to embrace
                      diversity a bit more. However the whole feel of the cover
                      is quite retro. The style of illustration and the rural
                      setting (the UK is very urbanised) both seem to looking
                      backward to me. I like the alliteration in the text. That
                      blazing hot sun disturbs me; it looks more like a nuke
                      going off than the gentle British sun I’m used to.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Liberal Democrats</h2>
                    <div>
                      <a
                        href="http://www.untyped.com/untyping/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/lib-dem-manifesto-sml.png"
                        ><img
                          decoding="async"
                          title="The Liberal Democrats Manifesto"
                          src="http://www.untyped.com/untyping/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/lib-dem-manifesto-sml.png"
                          alt=""
                          width="200"
                          height="284"
                      /></a>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                      It’s hard to say much about this cover, as it doesn’t say
                      much to me. The repetition of “fair” is effective, and
                      this is continued inside. The colours are washed out. This
                      cover doesn’t really inspire any emotion in me; it looks
                      more like an annual report than a manifesto!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Of the three I like the Labour cover the most, but as
                      you’ve seen none of them really worked for me. This isn’t
                      too surprising; major political parties must paint with
                      such a broad brush that they cannot really address any
                      small demographic. Now enough about the manifestos; go out
                      and vote!

                      Over Easter we insulated our roof. It was quite easy job,
                      but I’m not going to write much about it as this post is
                      entirely an excuse to show this picture:

                      No animal abuse was involved: he climbed up the ladder
                      into the loft and stayed there until we moved him to put
                      down more insulation.

                      For example: “I’ve gone nowhere on this macro in two

                      The term depends on an ambiguity between the medical term
                      flatline, indicating a patient is dead (as in “he
                      flatlined before we reached the hospital”), and the

                      implementation. Uses of the word that exclude either
                      meaning are incorrect, so one should not say, for example,
                      “I’m going to put a call on the Flattline”. One should
                      also not expect Matthew Flatt to solve all of one’s
                      problems.

                      Computer scientists pay almost as much attention to their
                      computers as they do to their clothing. From an informal
                      survey of the conference Apple is continuing its rise in
                      popularity amongst the geek crowd — the ratio of Mac to
                      PCs was about 1:1. Of course a Mac is about as close to a
                      fashion statement as a computer can come, so it isn’t
                      surprising to see this adoption.
