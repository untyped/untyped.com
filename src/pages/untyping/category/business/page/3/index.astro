                      Psychologists, for example, are big users of online
                      surveys. They would pay for better tools to generate and
                      score their surveys. It looks like Pollground are going
                      the ‘on-line billboard’ route, intending to rely on
                      advertising, but it is really too early to say what their
                      strategy is.

                    <p>
                      Yesterday we though we were about to go live on our
                      biggest application yet. The code has been installed on
                      the client’s server, it has been tested, and we think it’s
                      all ready to go. Then is starts raining down in London.
                      You wouldn’t think rain in Britain would be any big deal,
                      but not so. Somehow the rain finds its way through a
                      couple of storeys of building into the client’s server
                      room, and yes, drenches our server. Then the power goes
                      out. Net result is a server that won’t boot up when it
                      finally dries out. Luckily Dave happens to be going down
                      that way, and so finds himself in London installing the
                      software on a spare machine the client had. We think we’ll
                      still make the Thursday lauch date, but only just.

                    <p>
                      There are some good points; nothing surprising if you’ve
                      ever been involved in a startup but it is worth a read. My
                      main gripe: there is no Europe. It is a collection of
                      disparate countries with vastly different governments,
                      values, and so on. Capitalist UK is not socialist Denmark.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      That aside, by Paul’s criteria the real Cambridge is
                      pretty close to getting it right. It just might be too
                      expensive for real in-the-garage type startups. When
                      paying the rent is a challenge spending time on a risky
                      proposition like a startup seems less attractive.

                    <p>
                      Sometime in the last two days Yahoo Mail (which I use for
                      my personal email account) broke for me. I can no longer
                      reply to any email; clicking on the Reply button just
                      doesn’t do anything. I searched the web, couldn’t find
                      anything about it, so decided to email Yahoo support.
                      Below is my email and their response.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>
                        The ‘Reply’ button is broken on my system (Firefox 1.0.4
                        on Linux). It was working till a few days ago,
                        now clicking on the Reply button doesn’t go to the
                        ‘Compose’ screen.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I suspect a Javascript error. The following appears in
                        the Javascript console:
                      </p>
                      <p><em>… technical stuff …</em></p>
                      <p>
                        I’ve tried restarting Firefox and that doesn’t fix it.

                    <p>
                      Thanks for not reading my email Danny! <em>Had</em> you
                      bothered to read it, you’d have seen what you suggest
                      either I’ve already tried or is inapplicable. In fact you
                      would have seen that the problem is nothing to do with my
                      account, and everything to do with crappy broken code in
                      Yahoo Mail. It’s just too bad I can’t reply to your
                      message to tell you this directly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It’s amazing that bad customer service is worse than no
                      customer service. Before I contacted Yahoo I merely
                      slightly annoyed. I assumed they’d be aware of the problem
                      (I can’t be the only person facing this) and would fix it
                      reasonably soon. Now, as you’ve guessed, I’m rather more
                      angry. There’s a lesson there.

                        discussion.</em
                      >
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We’re building our new machine for ourselves, make no
                      mistake. We took this route because it looked cost
                      effective for the needs we had for ourselves. However, we
                      can, in theory, provide services to others as well—as our
                      server is more than capable of supporting more than just
                      untyped.
                    </p>
                    <p>But what services would we offer, and at what cost?</p>
                    <p>
                      We currently run Apache, Exim/Courier, Postgres and MySQL,
                      Subversion… in general, a full assortment of services that
                      users might want to make use of. Through judicious use of
                      LDAP, we’re hoping to expose some of these services
                      (email, WWW) without needing to provide full (shell)
                      accounts on the server. Likewise, we’re planning and
                      building scripts to automate many of our maintenance tasks
                      on the machine; we’re stopping short of CPanel, however.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So if we have the means to support other users, why would
                      I be hesitant? Because we are not an ISP. We are people
                      who enjoy making software. Our machine is like our
                      workbench—it provides the essential services we need to
                      make that software. Therefore, we have no interest in
                      trying to compete with your run-of-the-mill ISPs… you can
                      get a $5/month web account anywhere. So what kind of
                      hosting will we provide?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      At the least, I imagine we might offer hosting for “odd”
                      servers and languages. By “odd”, I mean “anything not
                      Apache.” For example, we know that there might be some
                      interest in the PLT Scheme; likewise, I imagine that
                      allowing servers written in Erlang may be of interest as
                      well. Beyond that… how much bandwidth can someone expect
                      to get hosting with us? Do we provide backup services?
                      What kind of quota does a user’s account come with? What
                      kind of response time to user requests are we going to try
                      and make good on?
                    </p>
                    <h3>Bandwidth</h3>
                    <p>
                      We will probably have 50GB of traffic per month in our
                      colo agreement. We will be charged beyond that as per
                      Bytemark’s policies. Therefore, I could simply pass on
                      costs to clients. Really, though, we’re not prepared to
                      deal with the administrative overhead of billing clients
                      for bandwidth, etc.; we’ll barely be in a position to
                      administer billing for basic services. Again, we’re back
                      to the mantra “we are not an ISP.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We’ll have bandwidth accounting in place; how you charge
                      for bandwidth, I don’t know. Just having to administer
                      this takes time, and time is money (“We are not an ISP…”).
                      Perhaps there’s a simple way to handle this… perhaps not.
                      I need to think more on this one; insights are welcome.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Backup</h3>
                    <p>
                      Backup is expensive. It takes careful scripting on the
                      host, regular movement of data from the server to a remote
                      site (see “Bandwidth,” above), and it takes time to
                      archive that to some kind of storage media. I don’t have a
                      tape jukebox anywhere near the server, nor can I afford
                      one (“We are not an ISP” ). Therefore, backup is an issue
                      of me having a second machine that runs a cron job, and
                      regularly pulls backups off the server. Then, I’ll have to
                      manually burn DVDs and/or make digital tapes archives of
                      that data. There are time and media costs involved in this
                      that are non-trivial.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Backup is something that typically is not offered with a
                      shell account, period. Taking a look at <a
                        href="http://www.mythic-beasts.com/pricelist.html"
                        >Mythic Beasts</a
                      >, their shell accounts start at £15 per quarter, they
                      offer 200MB of disk space, and there is no mention of
                      backup. I found some backup services while investigating
                      storage (below), and they charge a lot per month for 1GB
                      of backup (£25). This says to me that most hosting
                      facilities assume the following:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>You backup your own data</li>
                      <li>If the server dies, you’re on your own</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      I’m not committed to either route at this point, but it’s
                      clear that I should charge money for backup services. I’m
                      willing to spend my time to guarantee my own data’s
                      safety, but I’m not willing to do that for others, for
                      free.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Storage</h3>
                    <p>
                      What kind of quotas should we provide users? What can I
                      get shopping around the internet?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Point being? If I’m going to offer space, I have to charge
                      at least £1.75/GB; and since we’re not really in this
                      market space to compete, I’d probably have to charge more
                      than that (due to the administrative overheads, and
                      limited resources on our own machine). Furthermore, that’s
                      assuming it’s a gigabyte of <em>unarchived storage</em>.
                      It looks like sites that actually offer backup of a
                      gigabyte of data charge around £25/month for a gigabyte of
                      content that gets archived monthly. This doesn’t surprise
                      me in the least—offering security is an expensive
                      proposition, both in terms of tools and in terms of time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Again, comparing, <a
                        href="http://www.mythic-beasts.com/pricelist.html"
                        >Mythic Beasts</a
                      > charge £30 per month for a “developer” account with 1GB
                      of disk (no backup). The reality is (because we’re not an
                      ISP), we only have one server, with limited disk space. I
                      can resell storage from Bytemark, which eases the stress
                      on my own disks… but as can be seen, having active disk
                      space that you can serve out to the world costs money.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Administration</h3>
                    <p>
                      All these services take time to administer. Yes, we have
                      to do it for ourselves… but it’s another thing entirely to
                      have customers who want guarantees, and support when
                      things go wrong (regardless of whether it is at our end or
                      their end). What does administration cost? I can look at
                      other ISPs and see what they charge for adding a
                      subdomain, or configuring databases, or any of a host of
                      things… and I don’t want to get trapped in a situation
                      where we offer to do these things “for free,” and end up
                      playing sysadmin to a bunch of customers without any
                      recompense.
                    </p>
                    <p>Again, this is a tough one.</p>
                    <h3>In Conclusion… or, something like that</h3>
                    <p>
                      This isn’t necessarily the kind of laundry a small
                      business should air in public. Typically, this is the kind
                      of uncertainty that would be kept private, resolved
                      off-line, and then published to the world as policy.
                      However, these are probably the kind of questions that
                      others have wrestled with in their time, and it’s possible
                      someone who reads untyping may have some insights into
                      these issues that we don’t have. Given that we only have
                      one machine (“We are not an ISP”), it may be that we
                      should avoid hosting altogether. Or perhaps we can come up
                      with some reasonable terms of service and pricing
                      structures that reflect the quality and nature of services
                      we will offer. Who knows? Either way, they’re challenging
                      questions.

                        As we’ve been hinting on the blog our current project
                        has been close to delivery. Truth is, once we got a new
                        server set up the deadline passed without incident.
                        We’ve been waiting a few days to ensure there are no
                        problems, but it’s been long enough so we’re now happy
                        to announce the project is complete.
                      </p>

                        This work has been done for <a

                        > at Queen Mary University of London. We have
                        implemented a preregistration system for them: a website
                        by which students can be registered for courses and
                        modules, replacing a tedious and error-prone manual
                        system. Unfortunately there is no publically available
                        front-end so we can’t show off our work. However we have
                        a few projects that should be completed in the next
                        months that will have publically visible components.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The whole site runs on <a

                        the database. This is, to our knowledge, the first large
                        site to run the PLT Scheme web server continuously for
                        any length of time. Over the next few days we’ll provide
                        a few more details about the more intricate parts of our
                        setup so other intrepid pioneers can learn from our
                        work.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I normally read 37Signal’s blog through an RSS reader, so
                      I often don’t see the comments, but what I have seen does
                      have a largely negative tone. I can understand 37Signal’s
                      reasons but it does seem that by withdrawing from the
                      conversation they’re harming their relationship with their
                      community. Now JoelOnSoftware seems to be just as popular
                      as 37Signals but doesn’t seem to have the same problem, so
                      perhaps they offer a better model. Rather than having
                      comments on each post, Joel has a number of discussion
                      boards. Blogs (or at least blog comments) aren’t the
                      greatest thing for building community as there is clearly
                      a difference in power between the blog authors and the
                      comment writers. Discussion boards are much more
                      egaliterian and hence offer less opportunity to brew
                      discontent.

                      Authenticity is a big deal; perhaps <strong
                        >the
                      </strong>big deal for small companies. When people contact
                      a small company they want to talk to someone with a name,
                      not a random customer support droid. They want to feel a
                      personal connection to that company, and perhaps that a
                      little part of their success is due to them. Building this
                      connection is one reason we write Untyped, and also why we
                      have our
                      &lt;a href=&#8221;/about/index.php&#8221;&gt;dream
                      offices&lt;/a&gt; on our web pages. It also goes the
                      otherway: by<br />
                      personalising our web presence we feel a bit more like it’s ours.
                      In this early stage we aren’t working to build our careers,
                      we working to fulfill our passions, to build our dreams into
                      reality, and this sense of ownership is important.

                      What happens when a small company gets bigger? This
                      is were trouble hits: they
                      &lt;a href=&#8221;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_the_shark&#8221;&gt;jump
                      the shark&lt;/a&gt;. This might be the death knell for TV
                      shows, but normally companies just keep on getting bigger.
                      Except now people aren’t using their products out of any
                      attachment to the company, but because they are forced
                      to. The signs are that &lt;a

                      both companies we respect immensely, are tettering on the edge.

                      Is there anything that can be done about this? I’m
                      not sure. It’s a fact that as more people join a company
                      you can’t expect to know all of them, and vice versa. A
                      lot of companies spend a lot of money to try and project a
                      single voice, but this is really a symptom of the problem.
                      Perhaps the thing to do is let the babble overflow the
                      corporate boundaries, and let people make their own
                      connections with those inside, just like they used to? It
                      the opposite of standard marketing thinking, which is all
                      about protecting the brand, but perhaps showing the human
                      reality is the way to keep communication personal. Either
                      way, it will be a long time before we find out.
