                      I expect most people would say Baek. He does all the crazy
                      stuff, right? Looks hard and impressive, while Born is
                      just spinning around on the floor most of the time.
                      However, I expect most bboys would give it to Born, who in
                      fact did win that battle. Why? Born sets are well
                      constructed. He has a nice mixture of toprock (the stuff
                      standing up) and downrock (the stuff on the floor), and
                      mixes up the tempo with those pauses at 1:27 and 2:40.
                      Baek has great moves, but he just throws them down without
                      any real set up, and he messes up some of them, like the
                      hand-hop at 50s and the flares at 2:14. Also, when the
                      music changes he just wanders around the stage, not
                      dancing.

                      I like this video as its reminds me of an obvious but
                      sometimes forgotten point in software development: experts
                      are not everyone. Expert users are often the most vocal,
                      and when desiging software it can be very easy to let
                      their concerns dominate to the detriment of less skilled
                      but more numerous users. Sometimes a new feature is just <a

                      >, but sometimes it’s core to the target market. The only
                      way to tell the difference is to constantly keep in mind
                      who the customer is. Startups in particular can have
                      difficulty with this, as by definition a startup doesn’t
                      yet have any customers. Common advice to startups: <a

                      >, can be seen as mechanisms to put the developers into

                      our customers, and regular feedback from them is important

                    <p>
                      Ever thought about buying a franchise? Like the idea of
                      running<br />
                      your own business but don’t want the risk of trying it all<br
                      />
                      alone? How about farming? Attracted by the notion of<br />
                      growing all your own food, and connecting with nature? How<br
                      />
                      about both — franchised farming? Sounds unlikely, but<br
                      />
                      that’s essentially what SPIN farming is.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The core of SPIN farming is, well, farming, but not on<br
                      />
                      the scale that most people associate with modern farming<br
                      />
                      techniques. SPIN farmers typically work plots less<br />
                      than an acre in area, and achieve good returns by<br />
                      concentrating on the most profitable crops, and utilising<br
                      />
                      crop rotation to increase yield. The best<br />
                      description I’ve found is&lt;a<br />
                      href=&#8221;http://www.celsias.com/2007/02/07/spin-farming-part-ii-heeding-the-call-to-farm/&#8221;&gt;here,<br

                      though it isn’t very detailed.

                    <p>
                      In itself the farming techniques aren’t that radical. I<br
                      />
                      remember learning in high school that crop rotation was one<br

                      of the key innovations of the agrarian revoluation, and that<br

                      was some time ago (both high school, and the agrarian<br

                      revolution). What is novel is the way the SPIN farming<br

                      business is run, and that’s what causes me to call it a<br

                      franchise. Contained in the guide books (the&lt;a<br />

                      different from McDonalds. Now SPIN farming isn’t a true<br

                      franchise — you don’t buy the right to use the name,<br />

                      perhaps not for the financial gain of the founders.

                      The franchise idea, believe it or not, has great<br />

                      the franchise’s reproducable process? Perhaps by regarding<br
                      />
                      frameworks as franchises we can shift the emphasis from<br

                      technical development to supporting the developer in every<br

                      way they need to succeed. This seems to me a better goal<br

                        As a testament to how poorly that language can be
                        received, just witness how this support thread has
                        degraded since the post.

                        Seeing this, I’m now a FORMER last.fm customer. While
                        one customer may not matter in the short term, every
                        customer does count to a healthy business.

                      The same last.fm staff member then makes things just a
                      little bit worse with the following rather sarcastic
                      apology:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>
                        I hereby apologise to the tiny fraction of the 5% of our
                        userbase who are Mac users for offending them by the use
                        of the word “fuckload.” We’ll try and be more corporate
                        and sterile in future.
                      </p>

                    <p>
                      To be fair there were at least as many posts from people
                      who didn’t find the language offensive, or even liked it.
                      But the whole mess could have been avoided by simply
                      using, say, “shedload” in the original post, which would
                      have kept the character of the post without causing
                      offense. It pays to remember that on the big old Internet
                      not everyone shares the same values.

                      today when I asked the checkout operator what is was like
                      to work for the Partnership. To my great surprise she
                      responded very positively and could give me specific

                    <p>Some good quotes:</p>

                      <p>
                        All the best things that I did at Apple came from (a)
                        not having money and (b) not having done it before,
                        ever. Every single thing that we came out with that was
                        really great, I’d never once done that thing in my life.
                      </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>
                        I think what makes a good hack is the observation that
                        you can do without something that everybody else thinks
                        you need. To me, the most elegant hack is when somebody
                        says, “These 2,000 lines of code end up doing the same
                        thing as those 2 lines of code would do. I know it seems
                        complicated, but arithmetically it’s really the same.”
                        When someone cuts through a lot of crap and says, “You
                        know, it doesn’t really matter.”
                      </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                      There is a remarkable similarity to the two interviews.
                      Both emphasize simplicity and working under constraints.

                      taxi is exactly what the name suggests: an airplane that
                      takes you where you want to go, when you want to go. Now
                      clearly the infrastructure required for air taxis is a bit

                      the question “how do you make money?” is quite involved.

                      >. Essentially they run a massive constraint solving
                      system, juggling aircraft, airports, and travellers, and
                      they charge you by how difficult you make the constraints.
                      If you demand to travel in a small window of time it is
                      going to be difficult for them to find other passengers
                      for the plane, so you pay more. If you don’t particularly
                      care when you travel, or how long the journey takes, then
                      they might be able to fill the plane, or make a detour to
                      pick up other customers.  Hence you pay less.  This is an
                      elegant solution to a difficult problem, and I’m struck
                      that this is the type of solution, indeed the type of
                      industry, that can only exist because of information
                      technology. Even five years ago I doubt computer power was
                      cheap enough to make this feasible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Now just don’t get me started about the environmental
                      problems air taxis would cause. That’s a problem there is
                      no easy or elegant solution for.

                    <p>
                      We &#8220;went live&#8221; today with our second project
                      for Queen Mary, University of London: a content management
                      system for publishing course and staff homepages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The system is simple and intuitive: each homepage consists
                      of a single page of HTML, and doubles as an online
                      filestore. Members of staff can upload files such as
                      lecture notes and slides, and visitors to the page can
                      download them simply by clicking on a hyperlink. We use
                      the metaphor of <em>attachments</em> to relate this back
                      to the familiar process of writing an email.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The main page editor screen is split into two halves: a
                      WYSIWYG HTML editor (we used <a
                        href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/">TinyMCE</a
                      >) and a list of attachments (complete with controls for
                      uploading, renaming and deleting files). A separate
                      management interface allows administrative staff to set up
                      homepages for new courses and members of staff, assign
                      permissions for who can edit what, and flag <em
                        >external pages</em
                      > that are held off-site and not maintained with our
                      software.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      All of this new functionality is integrated into our
                      existing software for registering students on courses.
                      Members of staff access all their pages through a <em
                        >control panel</em
                      > that displays only the information they need, and
                      everything is nicely integrated with QMUL’s <a
                        href="http://idcheck.sourceforge.net/">IDCheck</a
                      > single sign-on service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Behind the scenes, the code for the CMS is based on a
                      prototype for our new component-oriented web UI library, <em
                        >LyluxUI</em
                      >. We still have a way to go before the code is ready for
                      open release, but it will eventually be available for
                      public consumption alongside our other open source
                      libraries, <a href="http://svn.untyped.com/snooze"
                        >Snooze</a

                      Investors in a startup always want to know how the startup
                      is going to get their money back — their exit strategy.
                      “Get bought by Google/Yahoo/Microsoft” is a pretty common
                      one in the Internet world. One I’ve never heard is “sell
                      the company’s assets on Ebay”. Well, that’s <a
