                      Currently, untyped lives on a virtual machine provided by <a
                        href="http://www.bytemark.co.uk/index.html">Bytemark</a
                      >. The service they provide is excellent, and we recommend
                      them highly. While we are building our own server we hope
                      to continue to host with Bytemark, but instead of being on
                      a VM, we’ll be on our own hardware. We’ll see how that
                      goes.

                      Today, Christian and I spent a few hours working on the
                      most fundamental part of a server: the filesystem. Before
                      I go into any detail about the decisions we made, I’ll
                      give you a sense for what we’re working with:

                      This server has seen use before, but we’ve replaced all
                      the moving parts; we’re quite pleased with its condition,
                      and think it will provide us with a number of years of
                      good service. And, we hope that we don’t need to do a
                      low-level install again in the next few years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The first thing we did was to grab a Debian 3.1r1 <a
                        href="http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/"
                        >“testing” net install</a
                      >CD image. We had to boot the 2.4 kernel, as the 2.6
                      kernel fails to load appropriate CD drivers from the
                      install CD; this didn’t really matter. Then, we came
                      around to our filesystem layout; what we knew was that we
                      wanted to partition off different parts of the directory
                      tree (/, /boot, /var, /usr, /tmp, /home); we didn’t know
                      exactly how much space to give each part of the
                      filesystem, however. Do we makehome 40GB, or 60GB? What
                      about usr? The list goes on and on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We started by setting up a 4GB swap partition at the end
                      of each drive, a 400MB boot partition at the front of each
                      drive, and setting aside the remaining 245GB or so for the
                      main parts of the filesystem. We then used the Debian
                      installer to turn the 400MB partitions into one RAID set,
                      and the 245GB partition into another. This way, both our
                      boot partition and the main part of the drive are in RAID,
                      but we’re guaranteed that our boot partition is at the
                      front of the disk.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      (What is RAID? I’ll stick with the <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundant_array_of_independent_disks"
                        >Wikipedia</a
                      > on that one. It keeps our two disk drives in perfect
                      sync; this way, if one of them fails, we might be able to
                      replace it before the second one does, thus keeping our
                      system running with little or no interruption. This is a
                      Good Thing.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Then, we dove into that big, 245GB space. We used LVM—the <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_%28Linux%29"
                        >Logical Volume Manager</a
                      >–to partition the rest of the disk. LVM is great because
                      it essentially ignores the physical layout of your disks,
                      and allows you to dynamically resize partitions without
                      any great gnashing of teeth. So, we laid out 40GB
                      for /home and /data, 20GB for /usr, and 4GB each
                      for /, /var, and /tmp.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Note that this is only 112GB of space; we had (roughly)
                      245GB of space in that big RAID set. Our intention is to
                      grow those partitions as we need to. For now, we chose
                      large, but reasonable values for each of these partitions.
                      In time, we may decide to increase the amount of space
                      allocated to /home—perhaps from 40GB to 80GB. The point
                      is, we have around 116GB of space to “grow into”, and we
                      can allocate it to any of the partitions we currently
                      have… or we can create new partitions. In either case,
                      these operations don’t require us to shutdown the machine,
                      or even take it entirely offline—we only need to “stop”
                      the logical volume that the partition is on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      While we could do this more quickly the second time
                      around, this took us between one and two hours; we were
                      careful to check our assumptions, and rehashed and
                      discussed a lot of the decisions in light of how we might
                      want to use the server in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Once the filesystem was set up, the rest of the
                      installation went quickly; things were pulled in
                      automatically over the network, and we rebooted into our
                      new machine. The filesystem looks great, and we expect
                      that the decisions we made will serve us well in the
                      future. Now, we’ll work on upgrading the kernel to a 2.6
                      series (with SMP support), and then begin replicating
                      those services that currently exist on the VM to the
                      server.

                      <p>
                        If you are a civilian like me (an anthropologist, that
                        is, without much technical savvy), it’s a little
                        mystifying. Will Internet 2.0 change everything or just
                        some things? Is this a revolutionary moment or an
                        evolutionary one? Is everything I know wrong, or just
                        this, that and the other thing? Is this 2.0h! or merely
                        2.0. …
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Here are three models that sort out the possibilities
                        for me.

                      My take: these changes will take place, but it will take
                      another generation, that grows up with the Internet, for
                      them to be fully realised.

                      It’s great to see industry adopting advanced programming
                      languages. Finance is not an entirely new domain for
                      functional programming. Simon Peyton-Jones wrote a <a

                      there is large literature of domain specific languages for
                      financial applications (for example <a

                        >Risla</a

                      language theory in this area.

                      I love how everyone and their brother has an opinion, and
                      it always stops there. I’d like to take a moment to rant,
                      and point out that opinions do not a curriculum make.

                      The question of “what is computer science?” has been
                      around for a while. The question of “what goes in a CS
                      curriculum?” has worked the academic circuit for a few
                      years as well. What’s great is that every Tom, Dick, and
                      Harry will come up with an opinion, but not a lot of
                      people work hard at actually trying to come up with a
                      justifiable answer.

                      Dan Zabonini is a Tom, Dick, and Harry. Over at O’Reilly’s
                      “Policy Center”, he’s posted his half-baked thoughts
                      online (http://www.onlamp.com/pub/wlg/7757); it isn’t
                      worth an active link. Just before a bulleted list of
                      random thoughts, he qualifies his thinking with this
                      choice quote:

                      <p>
                        So, what would you include in a modern Computer
                        Science/Software Engineering course? I’ve started
                        jotting some draft notes below (in no particular order,
                        this is just a stream of conciousness…)

                      > just a stream of consciousness, you might start reading
                      the ACM Model Curricula documents; I’ve read them all.
                      They’re complex, they consider a wide variety of issues,
                      and they reflect the state of the discipline at the time
                      they were written. Smart, hard-working people who have
                      given their lives to the study of computing, who spent a
                      lifetime teaching the discipline, crafted these documents.

                      particularly painful, as it defines an incredibly broad
                      disciplinary set, yet sets up evaluation criteria that,
                      75% of the time, can be met without a student ever
                      learning to program. Granted, in practice, programs are
                      not run this way, but the criteria (as stated) do not
                      explicitly require programming <em>skill</em>. I stress <em
                        >skill</em
                      >, because in most all CS departments, programming is not
                      taught as a scientific practice, but as a skill- or
                      craft-based activity. Again, there’s a literature on these
                      different kinds of knowledge (scientific vs. skill vs.
                      craft), and different theories of teaching and learning
                      associated with each.

                    <p>
                      The curriculum is under constant revision—often pushed and
                      pulled by industry and technology. Physics isn’t pulled
                      about this way; nor is Mathematics, Chemistry, or Biology.
                      Why is it, for example, that the AP curriculum was
                      switched from Pascal to C/C++, and then (in a just a few
                      short years) to Java? The language was incredibly young,
                      untested, and has a convoluted, involved syntax to do
                      simple things. From a first teaching of programming
                      perspective, it’s an abomination. You don’t think so?
                      Perhaps, then, you’ve never tried to teach 45-year-old
                      returning students how to program in Java then.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you’re going to walk around suggesting what should or
                      shouldn’t be in a computer science curriculum, then
                      perhaps you should begin by catching up on the arguments
                      that have been made for the last 40 years. While you’re at
                      it, I think it would be good if you understood the
                      fundamental research on reading and writing that’s been
                      done in the last 100 years, the research methodologies
                      that were employed in that exploration, and the
                      significance of the findings made with respect to teaching
                      and learning theory over the last five decades. I don’t
                      claim to have a complete grasp of all of this material,
                      but I’ve made a start—and that’s more than 98% of the
                      people who think, just because they can write some Java to
                      transform XML documents in a servlet container, that they
                      have important insights to offer the world regarding the
                      teaching and learning of programming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Once you’ve made a start on the literature, then we can
                      have an<em>informed</em> discussion, which is much more
                      interesting than pissing in the wind.

                      We don’t like to blow our own horn too hard, but around
                      untyped we do pretty well with a number of languages, and
                      Scheme is a favorite; we have a number of open-source
                      projects written in Scheme, and it drives some of our own
                      research projects as well. Fluxus looks like the kind of
                      platform that we might be able to do some very fun and
                      exciting things with.

                    <p>
                      There’s something wonderful about degree shows. The
                      students realise they’re on the cusp: they’ve finished
                      their training and soon it will be time to try and make an
                      impact on the world outside the University. In some ways
                      it’s the best of times, when everything is potential and
                      no limitations are set by the disappointments that from
                      time to time life brings. It’s been, well, too many years
                      since I finished my undergraduate eduation, but I
                      recaptured a bit of that feeling by being there.

                      Ostensibly an illustration course, the show included a
                      variety of work that stretched the definition of
                      illustration to the limit: t-shirts, masks, books, and
                      even videos. I was very impressed. The students had also
                      organised and paid for the whole event, including renting
                      the gallery and organising the drinks and entertainment. I
                      can’t recall Computer Science students ever organising an
                      event to equal this!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We took some photos; they’re <a

                      many cameras at the event so I’m hoping that Nils will be
                      able to get some better photos uploaded.

                      > exhibition showing this weekend.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Nils and his conspirators had developed a number of pieces
                      they wanted to present in a book, but did not like the
                      idea of printing dead-tree versions of the book for
                      everyone who came to the show. The brainstorm was to take
                      a video of the book, and have some way for the viewer to
                      turn the pages of the video/book by waving their hands in
                      the air… or some other apparently magical mechanism.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Christian and I were able to make that magic happen, and
                      the end-result is really quite nice (even if we do say so
                      ourselves!). Our first step was to explore an excellent
                      little application called<a
                        href="http://www.evological.com/evocam.html">EvoCam</a
                      >; this program lets you plug in an iSight video camera,
                      drag-and-drop regions on the video, and attach actions to
                      motion detected in those regions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      From there, it was just a hop, skip, and a jump to
                      controlling the video. We wrote a custom application for
                      Nils to easily mark the page-flip points, which we then
                      fed into the AppleScripts for controlling the player. The
                      true genius came from Nils, who realized that the
                      interface to a virtual book should be a <em>real</em
                      > book. So, the viewer turns the page on a real (but
                      blank) book, and the video follows the action. With a
                      little skinning of Quicktime Player, we eliminated the
                      control surfaces, and it looks just great on a black
                      background.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We don’t get to do things like this often enough; we like
                      to think that programming is an art, but how often do we
                      actually get to make art with our programming? When the
                      show goes up, we’ll get some pictures and video of the…
                      video. It will be great to see people interact with it!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you’re in London this weekend, please feel free to stop
                      in. The whole show looks like it will be great.
                    </p>
