                      Running a startup is a lot of work. All manner of tasks
                      constantly compete for the team&#8217;s attention
                      mandating a careful dance to keep on top of everything. We
                      haven&#8217;t nailed all the footwork to this dance yet,
                      but we have learned that choosing the right tool for each
                      job can drastically simplify the choreography.

                    <p>
                      We recently rewrote a large portion of <a
                        href="http://mynaweb.com/">Myna</a
                      >
                      in the march towards version 2 of the platform. Most of the
                      customer-facing software - the dashboard, client libraries,
                      HTTP API, and so on - were completely new and required
                      new documentation. Our existing help pages were in need of
                      an overhaul, so we decided to move them out into their own
                      project using a build system based on <a
                        href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a
                      > and
                      <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The new documentation is still a work-in-progress -
                      you can watch its evolution <a
                        href="http://help.mynaweb.com/">on the Myna website</a
                      > and its <a href="http://github.com/myna/help"
                        >repository on Github</a
                      >
                      (yes, it&#8217;s open source - another experiment we&#8217;re
                      trying). We&#8217;re really happy with the way it&#8217;s all
                      working out, so we&#8217;ve <a
                        href="https://github.com/untyped/jekyll-docs"
                        >published the build system</a
                      > as a separate project that you can use to bootstrap your
                      own documentation. Go forth, fork, and profit!
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Why Jekyll?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                      Our old documentation was implemented as a set of
                      templates in the <a href="http://playframework.org/"
                        >Play 2</a
                      > web app that runs our marketing site and original
                      customer dashboard. Publishing the app requires a PhD in
                      SBT, Mongo and Redis, and if you&#8217;re writing
                      documentation on the train (as we are prone to do) it
                      isn&#8217;t uncommon to have your plans abruptly
                      terminated by one of SBT&#8217;s frequent unavoidable
                      urges to
                      <a
                        href="http://blog.sonatype.com/people/2011/04/how-not-to-download-the-internet/"
                        >download the whole internet</a
                      > (unadvisable in the middle of signal-free rural
                      England).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We considered moving to a CMS such as WordPress, but our
                      support team are all developers with their own preferred
                      editors and IDEs. Forcing them to write documentation
                      (painful) in a tiny WYSIWYG editor embedded into a web
                      site seemed like torture. Also, CMSs require internet
                      connections&#8230; it kinda goes with the territory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Grunt and Jekyll, in contrast, run completely offline, and
                      have a number of other advantages too. Plugins like
                      <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch"
                        >grunt-contrib-watch</a
                      >
                      provide instant previews via
                      <a href="http://livereload.com/">Livereload</a>,
                      and Jekyll&#8217;s syntax highlighting (provided by <a
                        href="http://pygments.org/">Pygments</a
                      >) can highlight any syntax you throw at it (including, to
                      my amazement, <a
                        href="http://help.mynaweb.com/api/experiment-create.html"
                        >HTTP</a
                      >).<br />
                      Jekyll isn&#8217;t completely perfect for the job. We had to
                      work around a few issues. Fortunately, none of them proved
                      insurmountable:
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Versioning</strong></p>
                    <p>
                      We&#8217;ve run into versioning problems many times
                      before, some requiring some
                      <a
                        href="http://planet.racket-lang.org/package-source/untyped/autoplanet.plt/1/2/planet-docs/autoplanet/index.html"
                        >pretty serious workarounds</a
                      >. In fact, versioning issues are pretty much endemic
                      across all software development platforms. In this
                      toolchain we&#8217;re relying on lots of components:
                      Grunt, five Grunt plugins, Ruby, and Jekyll. Fortunately,
                      versioning is pretty much a solved problem these days:
                      <a href="https://npmjs.org/">NPM</a> and
                      <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> are great package managers
                      for Node, and
                      <a href="http://bundler.io/">Bundler</a> normalizes not only
                      the version of Jekyll we&#8217;re using, but also the version
                      of Ruby itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong
                        >Static Assets (Say &#8220;NO&#8221; to Plain CSS)</strong
                      >
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I may catch some flack for this, but CSS is a silly
                      language riddled with missing features and
                      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables/"
                        >bizarre design decisions</a
                      >. No way are we going to battle with a new documentation
                      project without tools like <a href="http://lesscss.org/"
                        >Less CSS</a
                      >
                      and
                      <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a
                      > to support us. And if we&#8217;re compiling and
                      minifying our CSS, we might do it for Javascript as
                      well. Jekyll doesn&#8217;t support support for either
                      process out-of-the-box.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      One way of solving these issues would be to use Jekyll
                      plugins - there are
                      <a href="https://github.com/zroger/jekyll-less">many</a>
                      <a href="https://github.com/moshen/jekyll-asset_bundler"
                        >candidates</a
                      >
                      <a
                        href="http://matthodan.com/2012/11/22/jekyll-asset-pipeline.html"
                        >available</a
                      >
                      on Github. However, we prefer to use Grunt for this kind of
                      thing, running Jekyll via
                      <a href="https://github.com/jharding/grunt-exec"
                        >grunt-exec</a
                      > and <a href="http://bundler.io/">Bundler</a>, and using
                      <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch"
                        >grunt-contrib-watch</a
                      >
                      and
                      <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect"
                        >grunt-contrib-connect</a
                      >
                      for preview functionality.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Content Navigation</strong></p>
                    <p>
                      Jekyll has built-in support for
                      <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/"
                        >cataloguing and paginating blog posts</a
                      >, but it can&#8217;t natively generate navigation for a
                      hierarchical documentation site. Fortunately, this was
                      easy to work around with a couple of custom plugins:
                      <a
                        href="https://github.com/untyped/jekyll-docs/blob/master/jekyll_plugins/nav_toc.rb"
                        >one to create a table of contents</a
                      >
                      for the sidebar, and one to
                      <a
                        href="https://github.com/untyped/jekyll-docs/blob/master/jekyll_plugins/nav_pager.rb"
                        >generate next and previous buttons</a
                      >
                      at the bottom of each page.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Authenticating Users</strong></p>
                    <p>
                      The main navigation bar on Myna changes when users log in.
                      Ideally we want like to keep this consistent across the
                      main web site, the blog, and the documentation. Our
                      solution is to built a small Javascript app to monitor the
                      user&#8217;s login details and rewrite the navbar on
                      demand. This is a work-in-progress project and it&#8217;s
                      not part of the Github repo above.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
                    <p>

                      The portfolio on <a href="/">untyped.com</a> was in need
                      of some love, so we’ve redesigned the site and brought it
                      up to date.

                    <p>
                      The new design is a lot simpler. We’ve combined the main
                      page with our new portfolio and given each project its own
                      distinctive look and feel. For example, the section for
                      Myna mimics <a href="http://mynaweb.com/">mynaweb.com</a>,
                      and the section on the <a
                        href="http://urbanriversurvey.org/"
                        >Urban River Survey</a

                      typewriter mascot against various Birmingham-based
                      backdrops. We’ve got such mileage out of these photographs
                      – they lend real character!

                      Alex for the great concept — our work is simply
                      implementing his vision.) The internship could extend this

                      Were I a betting man, I would wager this: the supermarket
                      nearest to you is laid out with fresh fruit and vegetables
                      near the entrance, and dairy and bread towards the back of
                      the shop. I’m quite certain I’d win this bet enough times
                      to make it worthwhile. This layout is, of course, no
                      accident. By placing essentials in the corners, the store
                      forces shoppers to traverse the entire floor to get their
                      weekly shop. This increases the chance of an impulse
                      purchase and hence the store’s revenue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I don’t know who developed this layout, but at some point
                      someone must have tested it and it obviously worked. The
                      same idea applies online, where it is incredibly easy to
                      change the “layout” of a store. Where the supermarket
                      might shuffle around displays or change the lighting, the
                      online retailer might change the navigational structure or
                      wording of their landing page. I call this process <em
                        >content optimisation</em
                      >.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Any prospective change should be tested to ensure it has a
                      positive effect on revenue (or some other measure, such as
                      clickthroughs). The industry standard method for doing
                      this is <a
                        href="http://untyped.wpengine.com/2010/07/22/epistemology-and-ab-testing/"
                        >A/B testing</a
                      >. However, it is well known in the academic community
                      that <em>A/B testing is significantly suboptimal</em>. In
                      this post I’m going to explain why, and how you can do
                      better.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are several problems with A/B testing:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        A/B testing is suboptimal. It simply doesn’t increase
                        revenue as much as better methods.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        A/B testing is inflexible. You can’t, for example, add a
                        new choice to an already running test.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        A/B testing has a tedious workflow. To do it correctly,
                        you have to make lots of seemingly arbitrary choices
                        (p-value, experiment size) to run an experiment.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      The methods I’m going to describe, which are known as <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit"
                        >bandit algorithms</a
                      >, solve all these problems. But first, let’s look at the
                      problems of A/B testing in more detail.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Suboptimal Performance</h2>
                    <p>
                      Explaining the suboptimal performance of A/B testing is
                      tricky without getting into a bit of statistics. Instead
                      of doing that, I’m going to describe the essence of the
                      problem in a (hopefully) intuitive way. Let’s start by
                      outlining the basic A/B testing scenario, so there is no
                      confusion. In the simplest situation are two choices, A
                      and B, under test. Normally one of them is already running
                      on the site (let’s call that one A), and the other (B) is
                      what we’re considering replacing A with. We run an
                      experiment and then look for a significant difference,
                      where I mean <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"
                        >significance</a
                      > in the statistical sense. If B is significantly better
                      we replace A with B, otherwise we keep A on the site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The key problem with A/B testing is it doesn’t respect
                      what the significance test is actually saying. When a test
                      shows B is significantly better than A, it is right to
                      throw out A. However, when there is no significant
                      difference the test is <em>not</em> saying that B is no
                      better than A, but rather that the data does not support
                      any conclusion. A might be better than B, B might be
                      better than A, or they might be the same. We just can’t
                      tell with the data that is available*. It might seem we
                      could just run the test until a significant result
                      appears, but that runs into the problem of <a
                        href="http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-run-an-ab-test.html"
                        >repeated significance testing errors</a
                      >. Oh dear! Whatever we do, if we stick exclusively with
                      A/B testing we’re going to make mistakes, and probably
                      more than we realise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A/B testing is also suboptimal in another way — it doesn’t
                      take advantage of information gained during the trial.
                      Every time you display a choice you get information, such
                      as a click, a purchase, or an indifferent user leaving
                      your site. This information is really valuable, and you
                      could make use of it in your test, but A/B testing simply
                      discards it. There are good statistical reasons to not use
                      information gained during a trial within the A/B testing
                      framework, but if we step outside that framework we can.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      * Technically, the reason for this is that the probability
                      of a type II error increases as the probability of a type
                      I error decreases. We control the probability of a type I
                      error with the p-value, and this is typically set low. So
                      if we drop option B when the test is not significant we
                      have a high probability of making a type II error.

                    <h2>Inflexible</h2>
                    <p>
                      The A/B testing setup is very rigid. You can’t add new
                      choices to the test, so you can’t, say, test the best news
                      item to display on the front page of a site. You can’t
                      dynamically adjust what you display based on information
                      you have about the user — say, what they purchased last
                      time they visited. You also can’t easily test more than
                      two choices.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Workflow</h2>
                    <p>
                      To setup an A/B experiment you need to choose the
                      significance level and the number of trials. These choices
                      are often arbitrary, but they can have a major impact on
                      results. You then need to monitor the experiment and, when
                      it concludes, implement the results. There are a lot of
                      manual steps in this workflow.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Make out like a Bandit</h2>
                    <p>
                      Algorithms for solving the so-called bandit problem
                      address all the problems with A/B testing. To summarise,
                      they give optimal results (to within constant factors),
                      they are very flexible, and they have a fire-and-forget
                      workflow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So, what is the bandit problem? You have a set of choices
                      you can make. On the web these could be different images
                      to display, or different wordings for a button, and so on.
                      Each time you make a choice you get a reward. For example,
                      you might get a reward of 1 if a button is clicked, and
                      reward of 0 otherwise. Your goal is to maximise your total
                      reward over time. This clearly fits the content
                      optimisation problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The bandit problem has been studied for over 50 years, but
                      only in the last ten years have practical algorithms been
                      developed. We studied one such <a

                        >UU</a
                      >. The particular details of the algorithm we studied are
                      not important (if you are interested, read the paper –
                      it’s very simple); here I want to focus on the general
                      principles of bandit algorithms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The first point is that the bandit problem explicitly
                      includes the idea that we make use of information as it
                      arrives. This leads to what is called the
                      exploration-exploitation dilemma: do we try many different
                      choices to gain a better estimate of their reward
                      (exploration) or try the choices that have worked well in
                      the past (exploitation)?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The performance of an algorithm is typically measured by
                      its <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regret_(decision_theory)"
                        >regret</a
                      >, which is the average difference between its actual
                      performance and the best possible performance. <a
                        href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0196-8858(85)90002-8"
                        >It has been shown</a
                      > that the best possible regret increases logarithmically
                      with the number of choices made, and <em

                      >, for instance).

                    <p>
                      Bandit algorithms are very flexible. They can deal with as
                      many choices as necessary. Variants of the basic
                      algorithms can handle addition and removal of choices,
                      selection of the best <em>k</em> choices, and exploitation
                      of information known about the visitor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Bandits are also simple to use. Many of the algorithms
                      have no parameters to set, and unlike A/B testing there is
                      no need to monitor them — they will continue working
                      indefinitely.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Finally, we know bandits work on the web, as much of the
                      current research on them is coming out of <a

                      So there you have it. Stop wasting time on A/B testing and

                      We’ve recently started a reading group at Untyped. As
                      consultants we need to maintain our expertise, so every
                      Friday we tackle something new for a few hours. Given our

                      Broadly, we’re covering the business of the web and the
                      business of building the web. The online business is, from
                      certain angles, quite simple. The vast majority of
                      businesses can be viewed as a big pipeline, sucking in
                      visitors from the Internet-at-large, presenting some
                      message to the user, and then hoping they click “Buy”. At
                      each stage of the pipeline people drop out. They drop out
                      right at the beginning if the site isn’t ranked high
                      enough on search terms or has poorly targetted ads. They
                      abandon the website if the design is wrong, or the site is
                      slow, or the offer isn’t targeted correctly. Each step of
                      this pipeline has tools and techniques that can be used to
                      retain users, which we’ll be covering. The flipside of
                      this is the pipeline that delivers the site, starting with
                      data stores, going through application servers, and
                      finishing at the browser or other client interface. Here
                      we’ll be looking at the technologies and patterns for
                      building great sites.

                      There is an interesting move underway by the US Securities
                      and Exchange Commission (SEC) to more precisely define the
                      meaning of certain asset backed securities (like the now
                      infamous mortgage-backed securities that were central to
                      the recent crash). The NY times has <a

                      > This is a step is the right direction but Python is not
                      the answer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The core problem here is to give a clear and unambiguous
                      meaning to a bond. This requires the language in which it
                      is written is precisely defined. Python is not precisely
                      defined. There is only a prose definition of the language,
                      which is inadequate in the same way that the prose
                      definitions of bonds are inadequate, and of course there
                      are differences between various versions and
                      implementation of Python. Since Python is not precisely
                      defined the only meaning one can give to a program in
                      Python is whatever the particular implementation one uses
                      does with that program.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In contrast there are languages that are formally defined,
                      such<a
                        href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/book-home.tcl?isbn=0262631814"
                        >Standard ML</a
                      > and <a
                        href="http://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs/r6rs-Z-H-15.html#node_idx_840"
                        >Scheme</a
                      >. These would make a sound basis for the formal
                      definition of bonds. In turns out that functional
                      languages also make a good (meaning expressive and
                      convenient) basis for the formal definition of bonds.
                      There is a great paper on <a
                        href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/financial-contracts/contracts-icfp.htm"
                        >expressing contracts in Haskell</a
                      > and at least <a href="http://lexifi.com/">one company</a
                      > has implemented this idea in a commercial system (in
                      O’Caml, I believe). So my advice to the SEC: use an
                      appropriate subset of Scheme or Standard ML, or hire
                      someone to create a formally defined DSL, but don’t use a
                      language without a formal definition if precision is your
                      goal.

                    <p>
                      Much has been written about the iPad since its launch. I’m
                      sympathetic to the concerns about the closed nature of the
                      iPad, and I think the iBookStore (along with the Kindle)
                      is going to have a big effect on the book market, but I
                      want to focus on something I haven’t seen much discussed:

                    </p>
                    <p>
                      What you need to know about the A4 is this: at its core is
                      an ARM<a
                        href="http://www.arm.com/products/CPUs/ARMCortex-A9_MPCore.html"
                        >Cortex-A9 MP</a
                      > CPU. ARM cores also power the iPhone and about every
                      other smartphone out there. Intel just can’t compete in
                      this market as their chips require too much power. This
                      weakness is, paradoxically, a result of their greatest
                      strength: the Intel instruction set. Even the most modern
                      Intel chip still retains the ability to execute code for
                      the ancient 8086. This ensures you can run just about any
                      program ever written for an Intel machine on the latest
                      CPU, giving Intel an enormous software base to leverage.
                      However supporting this instruction set comes at a cost.
                      The 8086 instruction set is not a good fit for modern CPU
                      designs, and the instruction set has accreted decades of
                      cruft to try and wedge modern features into it. To get
                      acceptable performance all modern Intel chips have vast
                      amounts of silicon devoted to instruction decoding; that
                      is, the process of turning instructions into so-called
                      micro-ops, which are what the CPU actually executes. All
                      this silicon takes power, which is why ARM handily beats
                      Intel on performance-per-Watt.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Now this wasn’t an issue for Intel even a few years ago.
                      But we’re seeing three things that ought to make them
                      worried. The first is the iPad, showing that little
                      devices can grow bigger and perhaps move into the PC
                      market, in much the same way PCs took over from the
                      scientific workstations of Apollo, DEC, Sun and others.
                      The second is the increasing concern for
                      performance-per-Watt from people like Google and Amazon
                      whose huge server farms power the major Internet services.
                      The third is open source software, and particularly GCC’s
                      support for just about every CPU on the market. This means
                      the software can be easily recompiled for a new
                      architecture. Suddenly Intel’s dominance doesn’t seem so
                      assured.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So perhaps in a few years ARM will become the dominant
                      architecture, rather than Intel. Apple have already shown
                      that switching architecture (twice!) isn’t so painful. And
                      as someone who has been writing an <a

                      When I went travelling in Spain I had a siesta just about
                      every day. There are very practical reasons for doing so:
                      it is so damn hot in the middle of the day, and, despite
                      being very close to the Prime Meridian, Spain is on +2GMT
                      in summer so the evenings last forever. Another benefit of
                      siestas: I felt great!

                      about napping. Now a lot of it shouldn’t come as a
                      surprise. Everyone knows the mid-afternoon lull (at
                      Untyped Midlands it tends to lead to a frenzy of piano
                      playing or drumming, for reasons I don’t understand) but
                      few of us heed the urge to sleep. Perhaps we should.
                      Remember to plan your naps: either get a full cycle (1.5
                      hours) or stop your nap after about 45 minutes. If you
                      wake in the middle of deep sleep you’ll feel terrible.

                    <p>
                      If you have problems getting to sleep, I recommend a cat
                      as a snoozing companion. They’re always ready for a nap
                      and purring is very relaxing. Furthermore, a good alarm
                      cat will stop your afternoon nap extending too close to
                      dinner time.
                    </p>

                      <a href="http://www.scribular.com/">Scribular</a> is a
                      website and iPhone app that takes the idea of<a

                      to user contributed notes about the place where you
                      currently are. The best part about Scribular if, like me,
                      you don’t have an iPhone, is that it is written in PLT
                      Scheme. It uses the <a href="http://leftparen.com/"
                        >LeftParen</a
                      > framework and you know LeftParen has to be awesome
                      because it in turn uses lots of libraries from Untyped!
                      Woo! Congratulations to Rob on launching. It is great to
                      see another entrepreneur using PLT Scheme in a commercial
                      setting.
