                      Running a startup is a lot of work. All manner of tasks
                      constantly compete for the team&#8217;s attention
                      mandating a careful dance to keep on top of everything. We
                      haven&#8217;t nailed all the footwork to this dance yet,
                      but we have learned that choosing the right tool for each
                      job can drastically simplify the choreography.

                    <p>
                      We recently rewrote a large portion of <a
                        href="http://mynaweb.com/">Myna</a
                      >
                      in the march towards version 2 of the platform. Most of the
                      customer-facing software - the dashboard, client libraries,
                      HTTP API, and so on - were completely new and required
                      new documentation. Our existing help pages were in need of
                      an overhaul, so we decided to move them out into their own
                      project using a build system based on <a
                        href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a
                      > and
                      <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The new documentation is still a work-in-progress -
                      you can watch its evolution <a
                        href="http://help.mynaweb.com/">on the Myna website</a
                      > and its <a href="http://github.com/myna/help"
                        >repository on Github</a
                      >
                      (yes, it&#8217;s open source - another experiment we&#8217;re
                      trying). We&#8217;re really happy with the way it&#8217;s all
                      working out, so we&#8217;ve <a
                        href="https://github.com/untyped/jekyll-docs"
                        >published the build system</a
                      > as a separate project that you can use to bootstrap your
                      own documentation. Go forth, fork, and profit!
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Why Jekyll?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                      Our old documentation was implemented as a set of
                      templates in the <a href="http://playframework.org/"
                        >Play 2</a
                      > web app that runs our marketing site and original
                      customer dashboard. Publishing the app requires a PhD in
                      SBT, Mongo and Redis, and if you&#8217;re writing
                      documentation on the train (as we are prone to do) it
                      isn&#8217;t uncommon to have your plans abruptly
                      terminated by one of SBT&#8217;s frequent unavoidable
                      urges to
                      <a
                        href="http://blog.sonatype.com/people/2011/04/how-not-to-download-the-internet/"
                        >download the whole internet</a
                      > (unadvisable in the middle of signal-free rural
                      England).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We considered moving to a CMS such as WordPress, but our
                      support team are all developers with their own preferred
                      editors and IDEs. Forcing them to write documentation
                      (painful) in a tiny WYSIWYG editor embedded into a web
                      site seemed like torture. Also, CMSs require internet
                      connections&#8230; it kinda goes with the territory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Grunt and Jekyll, in contrast, run completely offline, and
                      have a number of other advantages too. Plugins like
                      <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch"
                        >grunt-contrib-watch</a
                      >
                      provide instant previews via
                      <a href="http://livereload.com/">Livereload</a>,
                      and Jekyll&#8217;s syntax highlighting (provided by <a
                        href="http://pygments.org/">Pygments</a
                      >) can highlight any syntax you throw at it (including, to
                      my amazement, <a
                        href="http://help.mynaweb.com/api/experiment-create.html"
                        >HTTP</a
                      >).<br />
                      Jekyll isn&#8217;t completely perfect for the job. We had to
                      work around a few issues. Fortunately, none of them proved
                      insurmountable:
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Versioning</strong></p>
                    <p>
                      We&#8217;ve run into versioning problems many times
                      before, some requiring some
                      <a
                        href="http://planet.racket-lang.org/package-source/untyped/autoplanet.plt/1/2/planet-docs/autoplanet/index.html"
                        >pretty serious workarounds</a
                      >. In fact, versioning issues are pretty much endemic
                      across all software development platforms. In this
                      toolchain we&#8217;re relying on lots of components:
                      Grunt, five Grunt plugins, Ruby, and Jekyll. Fortunately,
                      versioning is pretty much a solved problem these days:
                      <a href="https://npmjs.org/">NPM</a> and
                      <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> are great package managers
                      for Node, and
                      <a href="http://bundler.io/">Bundler</a> normalizes not only
                      the version of Jekyll we&#8217;re using, but also the version
                      of Ruby itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong
                        >Static Assets (Say &#8220;NO&#8221; to Plain CSS)</strong
                      >
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I may catch some flack for this, but CSS is a silly
                      language riddled with missing features and
                      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables/"
                        >bizarre design decisions</a
                      >. No way are we going to battle with a new documentation
                      project without tools like <a href="http://lesscss.org/"
                        >Less CSS</a
                      >
                      and
                      <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a
                      > to support us. And if we&#8217;re compiling and
                      minifying our CSS, we might do it for Javascript as
                      well. Jekyll doesn&#8217;t support support for either
                      process out-of-the-box.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      One way of solving these issues would be to use Jekyll
                      plugins - there are
                      <a href="https://github.com/zroger/jekyll-less">many</a>
                      <a href="https://github.com/moshen/jekyll-asset_bundler"
                        >candidates</a
                      >
                      <a
                        href="http://matthodan.com/2012/11/22/jekyll-asset-pipeline.html"
                        >available</a
                      >
                      on Github. However, we prefer to use Grunt for this kind of
                      thing, running Jekyll via
                      <a href="https://github.com/jharding/grunt-exec"
                        >grunt-exec</a
                      > and <a href="http://bundler.io/">Bundler</a>, and using
                      <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch"
                        >grunt-contrib-watch</a
                      >
                      and
                      <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect"
                        >grunt-contrib-connect</a
                      >
                      for preview functionality.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Content Navigation</strong></p>
                    <p>
                      Jekyll has built-in support for
                      <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/"
                        >cataloguing and paginating blog posts</a
                      >, but it can&#8217;t natively generate navigation for a
                      hierarchical documentation site. Fortunately, this was
                      easy to work around with a couple of custom plugins:
                      <a
                        href="https://github.com/untyped/jekyll-docs/blob/master/jekyll_plugins/nav_toc.rb"
                        >one to create a table of contents</a
                      >
                      for the sidebar, and one to
                      <a
                        href="https://github.com/untyped/jekyll-docs/blob/master/jekyll_plugins/nav_pager.rb"
                        >generate next and previous buttons</a
                      >
                      at the bottom of each page.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Authenticating Users</strong></p>
                    <p>
                      The main navigation bar on Myna changes when users log in.
                      Ideally we want like to keep this consistent across the
                      main web site, the blog, and the documentation. Our
                      solution is to built a small Javascript app to monitor the
                      user&#8217;s login details and rewrite the navbar on
                      demand. This is a work-in-progress project and it&#8217;s
                      not part of the Github repo above.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
                    <p>

                        > frontpage. It was definitely fun getting all that
                        attention, despite the rush of traffic taking our little
                        server off the web for a while. (Installing <a

                        described in the blog post, and we’re accepting beta
                        users right now. If you’re interested in content
                        optimisation on your website, and want better results
                        than A/B testing will deliver, do take a look. Obviously
                        getting this surge of traffic from HN is incredibly
                        valuable to us. However I don’t have any suggestions for
                        repeating the event: when I submitted the blog post to
                        HN some months ago it disappeared without a trace.
                        Certainly being active answering questions on HN helped
                        keep it on the front page, and that position netted us a
                        fairly steady thousand hits an hour.

                        thanks for the interest! It’s very exciting for us to
                        know that our idea for improving content optimisation
                        resonates with so many people, and we’re looking forward
                        to getting Myna out of beta and seeing where it takes
                        us.

                      Were I a betting man, I would wager this: the supermarket
                      nearest to you is laid out with fresh fruit and vegetables
                      near the entrance, and dairy and bread towards the back of
                      the shop. I’m quite certain I’d win this bet enough times
                      to make it worthwhile. This layout is, of course, no
                      accident. By placing essentials in the corners, the store
                      forces shoppers to traverse the entire floor to get their
                      weekly shop. This increases the chance of an impulse
                      purchase and hence the store’s revenue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I don’t know who developed this layout, but at some point
                      someone must have tested it and it obviously worked. The
                      same idea applies online, where it is incredibly easy to
                      change the “layout” of a store. Where the supermarket
                      might shuffle around displays or change the lighting, the

                        >A/B testing</a
                      >. However, it is well known in the academic community
                      that <em>A/B testing is significantly suboptimal</em>. In
                      this post I’m going to explain why, and how you can do
                      better.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are several problems with A/B testing:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        A/B testing is suboptimal. It simply doesn’t increase
                        revenue as much as better methods.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        A/B testing is inflexible. You can’t, for example, add a
                        new choice to an already running test.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        A/B testing has a tedious workflow. To do it correctly,
                        you have to make lots of seemingly arbitrary choices
                        (p-value, experiment size) to run an experiment.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      The methods I’m going to describe, which are known as <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit"
                        >bandit algorithms</a
                      >, solve all these problems. But first, let’s look at the
                      problems of A/B testing in more detail.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Suboptimal Performance</h2>
                    <p>
                      Explaining the suboptimal performance of A/B testing is
                      tricky without getting into a bit of statistics. Instead
                      of doing that, I’m going to describe the essence of the
                      problem in a (hopefully) intuitive way. Let’s start by
                      outlining the basic A/B testing scenario, so there is no
                      confusion. In the simplest situation are two choices, A
                      and B, under test. Normally one of them is already running
                      on the site (let’s call that one A), and the other (B) is
                      what we’re considering replacing A with. We run an
                      experiment and then look for a significant difference,
                      where I mean <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"
                        >significance</a
                      > in the statistical sense. If B is significantly better
                      we replace A with B, otherwise we keep A on the site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The key problem with A/B testing is it doesn’t respect
                      what the significance test is actually saying. When a test
                      shows B is significantly better than A, it is right to
                      throw out A. However, when there is no significant
                      difference the test is <em>not</em> saying that B is no
                      better than A, but rather that the data does not support
                      any conclusion. A might be better than B, B might be
                      better than A, or they might be the same. We just can’t
                      tell with the data that is available*. It might seem we
                      could just run the test until a significant result
                      appears, but that runs into the problem of <a
                        href="http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-run-an-ab-test.html"
                        >repeated significance testing errors</a
                      >. Oh dear! Whatever we do, if we stick exclusively with
                      A/B testing we’re going to make mistakes, and probably
                      more than we realise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A/B testing is also suboptimal in another way — it doesn’t
                      take advantage of information gained during the trial.
                      Every time you display a choice you get information, such
                      as a click, a purchase, or an indifferent user leaving
                      your site. This information is really valuable, and you
                      could make use of it in your test, but A/B testing simply
                      discards it. There are good statistical reasons to not use
                      information gained during a trial within the A/B testing
                      framework, but if we step outside that framework we can.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      * Technically, the reason for this is that the probability
                      of a type II error increases as the probability of a type
                      I error decreases. We control the probability of a type I
                      error with the p-value, and this is typically set low. So
                      if we drop option B when the test is not significant we
                      have a high probability of making a type II error.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Inflexible</h2>
                    <p>
                      The A/B testing setup is very rigid. You can’t add new
                      choices to the test, so you can’t, say, test the best news
                      item to display on the front page of a site. You can’t
                      dynamically adjust what you display based on information
                      you have about the user — say, what they purchased last
                      time they visited. You also can’t easily test more than
                      two choices.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Workflow</h2>
                    <p>
                      To setup an A/B experiment you need to choose the
                      significance level and the number of trials. These choices
                      are often arbitrary, but they can have a major impact on
                      results. You then need to monitor the experiment and, when
                      it concludes, implement the results. There are a lot of
                      manual steps in this workflow.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Make out like a Bandit</h2>
                    <p>
                      Algorithms for solving the so-called bandit problem
                      address all the problems with A/B testing. To summarise,
                      they give optimal results (to within constant factors),
                      they are very flexible, and they have a fire-and-forget
                      workflow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So, what is the bandit problem? You have a set of choices
                      you can make. On the web these could be different images
                      to display, or different wordings for a button, and so on.
                      Each time you make a choice you get a reward. For example,
                      you might get a reward of 1 if a button is clicked, and
                      reward of 0 otherwise. Your goal is to maximise your total
                      reward over time. This clearly fits the content
                      optimisation problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The bandit problem has been studied for over 50 years, but
                      only in the last ten years have practical algorithms been
                      developed. We studied one such <a

                        >UU</a
                      >. The particular details of the algorithm we studied are
                      not important (if you are interested, read the paper –
                      it’s very simple); here I want to focus on the general
                      principles of bandit algorithms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The first point is that the bandit problem explicitly
                      includes the idea that we make use of information as it
                      arrives. This leads to what is called the
                      exploration-exploitation dilemma: do we try many different
                      choices to gain a better estimate of their reward
                      (exploration) or try the choices that have worked well in
                      the past (exploitation)?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The performance of an algorithm is typically measured by
                      its <a

                        >regret</a
                      >, which is the average difference between its actual
                      performance and the best possible performance. <a

                        >It has been shown</a
                      > that the best possible regret increases logarithmically
                      with the number of choices made, and <em

                    <p>
                      Bandit algorithms are very flexible. They can deal with as
                      many choices as necessary. Variants of the basic
                      algorithms can handle addition and removal of choices,
                      selection of the best <em>k</em> choices, and exploitation
                      of information known about the visitor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Bandits are also simple to use. Many of the algorithms
                      have no parameters to set, and unlike A/B testing there is
                      no need to monitor them — they will continue working
                      indefinitely.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Finally, we know bandits work on the web, as much of the
                      current research on them is coming out of <a
