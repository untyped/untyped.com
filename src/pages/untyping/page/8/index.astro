                      Delirium is a web-browser automation toolkit, which means
                      it’s a Scheme library that provides a bunch of functions
                      that you can use to control a web browser. We expect the
                      primary use will be for web testing, and Delirium can be
                      used inside SchemeUnit like any other Scheme library.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For the Schemers Delirium isn’t anything special, but we
                      believe the use of continuations make Delirium a major
                      advance over similar web testing tools like Selenium. If
                      you write your server code in Scheme you can directly test
                      how your server side responds to web tests with tests
                      running on the same server. That is to say a test can
                      interleave calls to the web browser and to the server side
                      code, which is impractical without continuations. This
                      features makes it much easier to write reliable and
                      comprehensive tests.

                      At last — the long awaited ICFP post! In summary: ICFP was
                      awesome. Freiburg is lovely, the German beer is fantastic,
                      and everyone at the conference was very friendly. It was
                      great to put faces to people we’ve conversed with for
                      years, to meet old friends, and to make new ones.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We gave two talks, one at ICFP on our work building web
                      sites in Scheme (<a
                        href="http://www.untyped.com/downloads/icfp068-welsh.pdf"
                        >paper here</a
                      >), and one at <a href="http://cufp.galois.com/">CUFP</a
                      > (<a
                        href="http://cufp.galois.com/slides/2007/NoelWelsh.tar.gz"

                        >PDF slides</a
                      >). Both were, I think, well received: a few people
                      expressed some interest in having us come and talk to
                      their groups, and the CUFP organisers invited us to join
                      them at dinner.

                      There was a definite buzz about ICFP. It seems functional
                      languages are beginning to take off — CUFP doubled its
                      attendence over last year, and ICFP strained the capacity
                      of the hotel. There was something of a reality distortion
                      field in place though. After a few days at the conference
                      you could begin to believe the entire software market
                      consisted of either program verification tools in Haskell
                      or telephony apps in Erlang. There was little
                      representation from web developers, who I think must make
                      up the largest group of commercial developers. I believe
                      this is because Haskell users really dominate ICFP, and
                      Haskell doesn’t have a particularly good web development
                      story as far as I know.

                      It was interesting to see how the other communities are
                      developing. The Haskell guys had a <a

                      is a <a href="http://www.realworldhaskell.org/blog/"

                      Scheme. Erlang seemed to have slightly better industry
                      representation and also has several recent
                      practically-oriented publications. I heard that many
                      people had arrived just for the Erlang workshop, which was
                      held the day after CUFP.

                      Of course the conference revolved around the paper
                      presentations. There were too many to review them all, so
                      I’ll just note the ones that were particularly relevant to
                      our work at Untyped.

                      web server. Matthew hacked <a

                      1028 slides made for some slick animations that quickly
                      and clearly got across the concept of delimited
                      continuations. This was perhaps the best presentation I
                      saw at the conference and it was on something we’ll
                      definitely be using.

                      the first half which is essentially a tutorial on
                      intermediate to advanced macrology. There is precious
                      little material available on this corner of Scheme, so it

                      One point from ICFP that is particularly relevant for this
                      blog: Dave Herman told me he’d like to see more technical
                      posts. I’ve tried to make the content a bit more technical
                      of late, but if there is anything in particular you’d like
                      me to write about drop me a line.

                      Computer scientists pay almost as much attention to their
                      computers as they do to their clothing. From an informal
                      survey of the conference Apple is continuing its rise in
                      popularity amongst the geek crowd — the ratio of Mac to
                      PCs was about 1:1. Of course a Mac is about as close to a
                      fashion statement as a computer can come, so it isn’t
                      surprising to see this adoption.

                    <p>
                      In the web-server’s terminology a dispatcher is a<br />
                      function that may generate a response given a request.<br
                      />
                      Examples includes the filesystem dispatcher, which responds<br
                      />
                      to requests with the contents of a file, and the servlet<br
                      />
                      dispatcher, which invokes a servlet. Dispatchers are<br />
                      arranged in a list. The first dispatcher in the list<br />
                      inspects the request and, if it decides the request is<br
                      />
                      relevant, generates a response. Otherwise control is passed<br
                      />
                      to the next dispatcher in the list. For some time now the<br
                      />
                      web-server has had a configurable dispatcher pipeline, which<br
                      />
                      can be set by simply passing a value with the<br />
                      <code>#:dispatch</code> keyword to the <code>serve</code
                      ><br />
                      function.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The web-server provides a number of dispatchers, all in<br
                      />
                      the <code
                        >&lt;a<br />
                        href="http://svn.plt-scheme.org/plt/trunk/collects/web-server/dispatchers/"&gt;dispatchers</code
                      ><br />
                      subdirectory of the <code>web-server</code> collection.<br
                      />
                      They all provide a <code>make</code> function that does
                      most<br />
                      of the work. Here’s how to use the file, servlet, and<br
                      />
                      sequence dispatchers, the most generally useful ones:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        The file dispatcher, in<br />
                        <code>dispatch-files.ss</code>, takes a single
                        parameter, a<br />
                        function that converts a URL to a path (and another value<br
                        />
                        that the dispatcher ignores). The path can name a file,<br
                        />
                        which the dispatcher will serve if such a file actually<br
                        />
                        exists, or it can name a directory, in which case the<br
                        />
                        dispatcher will look for a file within that directory called<br
                        />
                        <code>index.html</code> or <code>index.htm</code>.
                        <p>
                          To use the file dispatcher you will probably want the<br
                          />
                          handy <code>make-url-&gt;path</code> function in<br />
                          <code>filesystem-map.ss</code>. Pass this function a
                          base<br />
                          path (the directory where your files live), and it will<br
                          />
                          return a function suitable to pass to the file<br />
                          dispatcher.
                        </p>
                        <p>Here’s an example of use:</p>
                        <pre
                          is:raw>
(require
(prefix file: (lib "dispatch-files.ss" "web-server" "dispatchers"))
(lib "filesystem-map.ss" "web-server" "dispatchers"))

(define base-path (string-&gt;path "/my/directory/of/files"))

;; htdocs-url-&gt;path : path -&gt; (url -&gt; path (list-of path-element))
(define (htdocs-url-&gt;path path)
(make-url-&gt;path (path-&gt;complete-path path)))

;; dispatch-htdocs : (connection request -&gt; response)
(define dispatch-htdocs
(file:make #:url-&gt;path (htdocs-url-&gt;path base-path)))</pre>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The servlet dispatcher, in <code
                          >dispatch-servlets.ss</code
                        > is a bit more difficult to use as you need a function
                        from the <code>private</code>subcollection of the
                        web-server, suggesting the code reorganisation isn’t
                        quite finished. The <code>make</code> function takes two
                        arguments, the first being a <code>cache-table</code>,
                        and the second being a function that, like for the file
                        dispatcher, maps URLs to paths. To construct a <code
                          >cache-table</code
                        > use the following lines of code:
                        <pre
                          is:raw>
(require
(lib "cache-table.ss" "web-server" "private"))

(define cache-table (box (make-cache-table)))</pre>
                        <p>
                          If you want all URLs to go a particular servlet, as in
                          Instaweb, the URL to path function just needs to
                          return the path of the servlet. The function used in
                          Instaweb is this:
                        </p>
                        <pre
                          is:raw>
;; serlvet-url-&gt;path : url -&gt; path (list-of path-element)
(define (servlet-url-&gt;path url)
(let ([complete-servlet-path (path-&gt;complete-path servlet-path)])
(values complete-servlet-path (explode-path* complete-servlet-path))))</pre>
                        <p>Now we can create a dispatcher as follows:</p>
                        <pre
                          is:raw>
;; clear-servlet-cache! : -&gt; void
;; dispatch-servlets:    connection request -&gt; response
(define-values (clear-servlet-cache! dispatch-servlets)
(servlet:make (box (make-cache-table))
#:url-&gt;path servlet-url-&gt;path))</pre>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The sequencer dispatcher couldn’t be easier to use. It
                        just takes any numbe of dispatchers and creates new
                        dispatcher that tries them in sequence. For example:
                        <pre
                          is:raw>
;; dispatch-all : connection request -&gt; response
(define dispatch-all
(sequencer:make dispatch-htdocs
dispatch-servlets))</pre>
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                      With the above you should be able to create your own
                      custom dispatchers. If you have problems just read the
                      (very short) Instaweb code!
                    </p>
                  </div>

                    <p>
                      Over the last weekend, and sporadically this week, the
                      computer that hosts untyped.com and Untyped’s email server
                      has been under attack from a network of spam bots. It
                      doesn’t appear that we’ve been targeted specifically.
                      Rather, it seems that the bots are scanning for email
                      addresses to spam, presumably to propagate the bots. It
                      took down our email server over the weekend, but we’ve
                      since taken steps to combat the flood of traffic. However,
                      if you sent us an email and are waiting for a response,
                      you might want to send it again.

                    <p>
                      We’d don’t know what bot is attacking us, but there is a
                      good chance it is the <a

                      >. I didn’t know of the Storm Worm before we were
                      attacked; my reading since then indicates it is a truly
                      massive network, with the potential to cause a lot of
                      trouble. <a

                      I personally watch commits go by for several projects, and
                      it is instructive in many ways to read the commit messages
                      and code. It is a way to learn new things about the
                      software process as well as the implementation of
                      solutions in code. That said, very occasionally, you
                      actually get a giggle from the process…

                      Dave and Noel are a bit cracked out today. Perhaps they
                      should be out playing frisbee instead of coding this fine

                      There were a few extra details in there that convinced me
                      that this<br />
                      wasn’t spam, but that was the gist of it. I logged on to my
                      account to<br />
                      find that my balance was a whopping $0.01. A single cent!

                      I checked my credit card details and they seemed to be
                      okay. I<br />
                      re-entered them to be on the safe side, and then emailed AWS
                      asking<br />
                      them to re-try the payment and let me know if it failed again.

                      The code I spent most time on was the HTTP parser. It is
                      structured as a state machine, so the initial version used
                      the classic FP pattern of<a

                      >. The code for parsing an HTTP request looked something
                      like this:

                    <p>
                      The code for parsing an HTTP response was very similar:
                    </p>
                    <div>
                      <pre

                      The real code was several screens long. I wanted to make
                      it<br />
                      simpler by changing to a functional style, and reusing<br

                      common code between the request and response parsing<br />
                      functions. Converting to functional style is simple:
                    </p>
                    <div>
                      <pre

(parse-headers request-line))

(define (parse-headers request-line)

null
(cons line (loop (read-line))))))

                    <p>
                      Reusing common code is not simple. The finite state
                      machine<br />
                      pattern doesn’t abstract the next state. For example<br />
                      <code>parse-headers</code> in <code>parse-request</code
                      ><br />
                      always calls <code>do-something</code> whereas the
                      otherwise<br />
                      identical version in <code>parse-response</code> calls<br
                      />
                      <code>do-something-different</code>.

                    <p>
                      I solved this by refactoring the code into&lt;a<br />

                      style, leading to code that looks like the following:

                        arguments lists were quite a bit longer in the real code
                        and<br />
                        most of the time arguments are just passed from function
                        to<br />
                        function without being used (I’ve seen these sort of<br
                        />
                        arguments called “tramp data”). I also find<br />
                        that CPSed code can be quite difficult to read — you<br

                        have to construct the control flow graph in your head and<br
                        />
                        then look at the application site to fill in all the<br
                        />
                        continuations. Ugh.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        One way to get rid of tramp data is to use <code
                          >parameters</code
                        >, and this something we talk about in our <a
                          href="http://www.untyped.com/untyping/archives/2007/08/a_scheme_case_s_1.html"
                          >experience report</a
                        >. However that solution isn’t appropriate here. It
                        forces me to stick with CPS so I can set the parameters
                        in the dynamic extent of the succeeding code, and it
                        extends the lifetime of the values beyond what is
                        strictly necessary. This could be an issue if storing,
                        say, a large request body in a parameter.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Notice that the different versions of<br />
                        <code>parse-request</code> only differed in which
                        function<br />
                        they called with the value they computed. If I separate out<br
                        />
                        the computation of that value, and the decision of which<br
                        />
                        function to call I can get code reuse without CPS, and I<br
                        />
                        don’t have long argument lists! This is what my final solution
                        looks like:

                          I started with the mutually tail-recursive FSM pattern
                          (that’s a mouthful!)
                        </li>
                        <li>I refactored into continuation-passing style.</li>
                        <li>
                          I separated computation and control, and refactored
                          back to direct style.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>
                        So three refactoring (direct style to CPS, separating<br

                        computation and control, and CPS to direct style), two of<br
