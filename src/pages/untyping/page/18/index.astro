                      I love how everyone and their brother has an opinion, and
                      it always stops there. I’d like to take a moment to rant,
                      and point out that opinions do not a curriculum make.

                      The question of “what is computer science?” has been
                      around for a while. The question of “what goes in a CS
                      curriculum?” has worked the academic circuit for a few
                      years as well. What’s great is that every Tom, Dick, and
                      Harry will come up with an opinion, but not a lot of
                      people work hard at actually trying to come up with a
                      justifiable answer.

                      Dan Zabonini is a Tom, Dick, and Harry. Over at O’Reilly’s
                      “Policy Center”, he’s posted his half-baked thoughts
                      online (http://www.onlamp.com/pub/wlg/7757); it isn’t
                      worth an active link. Just before a bulleted list of
                      random thoughts, he qualifies his thinking with this
                      choice quote:

                    <blockquote>
                      <p>
                        So, what would you include in a modern Computer
                        Science/Software Engineering course? I’ve started
                        jotting some draft notes below (in no particular order,
                        this is just a stream of conciousness…)

                      If you want some thoughts on the topic that are <em

                      the ACM Model Curricula documents; I’ve read them all.
                      They’re complex, they consider a wide variety of issues,
                      and they reflect the state of the discipline at the time
                      they were written. Smart, hard-working people who have
                      given their lives to the study of computing, who spent a
                      lifetime teaching the discipline, crafted these documents.

                      particularly painful, as it defines an incredibly broad
                      disciplinary set, yet sets up evaluation criteria that,
                      75% of the time, can be met without a student ever
                      learning to program. Granted, in practice, programs are
                      not run this way, but the criteria (as stated) do not
                      explicitly require programming <em>skill</em>. I stress <em
                        >skill</em
                      >, because in most all CS departments, programming is not
                      taught as a scientific practice, but as a skill- or
                      craft-based activity. Again, there’s a literature on these
                      different kinds of knowledge (scientific vs. skill vs.
                      craft), and different theories of teaching and learning
                      associated with each.

                    <p>
                      The curriculum is under constant revision—often pushed and
                      pulled by industry and technology. Physics isn’t pulled
                      about this way; nor is Mathematics, Chemistry, or Biology.
                      Why is it, for example, that the AP curriculum was
                      switched from Pascal to C/C++, and then (in a just a few
                      short years) to Java? The language was incredibly young,
                      untested, and has a convoluted, involved syntax to do
                      simple things. From a first teaching of programming
                      perspective, it’s an abomination. You don’t think so?
                      Perhaps, then, you’ve never tried to teach 45-year-old
                      returning students how to program in Java then.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you’re going to walk around suggesting what should or
                      shouldn’t be in a computer science curriculum, then
                      perhaps you should begin by catching up on the arguments
                      that have been made for the last 40 years. While you’re at
                      it, I think it would be good if you understood the
                      fundamental research on reading and writing that’s been
                      done in the last 100 years, the research methodologies
                      that were employed in that exploration, and the
                      significance of the findings made with respect to teaching
                      and learning theory over the last five decades. I don’t
                      claim to have a complete grasp of all of this material,
                      but I’ve made a start—and that’s more than 98% of the
                      people who think, just because they can write some Java to
                      transform XML documents in a servlet container, that they
                      have important insights to offer the world regarding the
                      teaching and learning of programming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Once you’ve made a start on the literature, then we can
                      have an<em>informed</em> discussion, which is much more
                      interesting than pissing in the wind.

                      can have some complex interaction modes that are annoying

                        >The Birmingham Course</a
                      > approached us with the idea of<br />
                      placing online a mock exam for their MRCPsych course. While
                      the time constraints were tight, we thought there was an interesting
                      opportunity in the project, and enjoyed the enthusiasm that
                      The Birmingham Course brought to the table.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I would have liked to do some paper prototyping, and work
                      through the issues that might arise before starting.
                      However, we also wanted students currently enrolled in the
                      course to trial an on-line version of the mock exam. This
                      left us in a bit of a pickle: can you, in one-and-one-half
                      weeks, go from concept to implementation for an on-line
                      examination, and get it right? (I live far enough away
                      from Birmingham that I didn’t have the ability to take a
                      day or two and go up there to meet with the client.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The mock exam had no data gathering requirements, nor were
                      there any concerns with authentication and identifying
                      users. Therefore, some of the trickier aspects of
                      web-based application development were not concerns.
                      However, we still needed to deliver 133 True/False
                      questions, and 30 multiple-choice questions in a stateful
                      way, so students could easily “go back” and change their
                      answers, as well as get their end-of-exam score.

                      While there may be AJAX gurus out there who think this
                      would be a piece of cake, I do almost all of this
                      development work in Scheme, and have no particular
                      expertise in HTML/CSS/Javascript interaction on twelve
                      different browser platforms (that’s why I <a
                        href="http://www.untyped.com/about/index.php"
                        >run with a team</a
                      >). I certainly don’t have a lot of patience for
                      developing code in an unstructured and unsupportive
                      environment. Put another way, I think the browser makes a
                      lousy run-time environment; I want my compiler to check
                      for obvious problems up front, and I want my runtime
                      environment to be rich enough that I can go about
                      debugging a running application. Your typical AJAX app
                      fails on these counts far too readily for me to think that
                      any AJAX code I develop in a hurry will be reliable. (I’d
                      like to point out that I’ve never even given AJAX enough
                      of my time to decide if my biases and opinions are right;
                      I’ve only read code and stories from others, and I don’t
                      like what I see.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Enter <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/">OpenLaszlo</a>.
                      It has a compiler, that tells me when I make silly
                      mistakes. It has a rich run-time environment, which
                      includes an interactive debugging REPL. I can create a
                      window as easily as saying
                    </p>
                    <pre
                      is:raw>
&lt;canvas&gt;&lt;window&gt;Hi there!&lt;/window&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;</pre>
                    <p>
                      It uses JavaScript 1.5 as it’s scripting language, and has
                      a really sweet little constraint engine built in. The
                      upcoming 3.1 release has some very swish enhancements on
                      the way as well.

                      I was able to quickly prototype ideas for the customer,
                      push them to the WWW, and let them interact with the
                      application. While it is possible to do all kinds of RPC
                      from OpenLaszlo, I chose to employ another really nice
                      feature of the environment: <a
                        href="http://openlaszlo.org/tips/2005/solo/"
                        >SOLO application deployment</a
                      >. If you’re willing to give up some (not all)
                      connectivity with remote hosts, OpenLaszlo apps can be
                      compiled to a single, static Flash file. This means that
                      any user with Flash 6 or better can interact with a very
                      rich net-based app, and get a very desktop-like
                      experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The <a
                        href="http://birminghamcourse.untyped.com/mock-exam/"
                        >end-product of a one-week mad dash</a
                      > can be seen online; I was quite pleased with it. I know
                      I made some choices that were less than optimal, but the
                      code can be refactored and improved in a future iteration
                      of the project. I was also happy working with OpenLaszlo
                      as a development tool—putting together GUIs was no more
                      complex than writing a webpage, the event model and
                      constraint system are both well-behaved and useful, and
                      being able to deliver a static Flash document as an
                      application means I don’t have to worry about a timeouts
                      on client/server interactions, nor do I have to wonder if
                      IE4/IE5/IE6/Opera/Firefox/Mozilla/Safari is going to choke
                      on my particular choice of HTML, CSS, and Javascript
                      idioms. If you’re some kind of “purist” who abhors Flash,
                      then… I can’t help you. But it’s widely deployed, and much
                      better behaved than a gaggle of browsers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Food for thought. Point is, I liked it. And the customer
                      loved it; the app behaved just the way they wanted. I
                      don’t know what else I can say.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      While I was away on holiday Apple released two new
                      products, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/"
                        >iPod Nano</a
                      >, and an <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/mobile/"
                        >iTunes equipped phone</a
                      > in collaboration with Motorola. Apple is currently the
                      biggest innovator in hardware design so it is worth
                      looking at what they come up with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In the case of the iPod Nano this is one sleek device. It
                      takes the existing iPod design and makes it smaller and
                      sexier. I suspect this product is driven more by
                      improvements in storage technology allowing a smaller
                      device than any plan to evolve the iPod design, but it
                      sure looks nice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The iTunes phone though disappoints me. iPods have smooth
                      surfaces, with a minimum of visual noise. This phone is a
                      brick, with all sorts of unnecessary fuss such as the
                      two-tone colour scheme and the raised M on the front. It
                      doesn’t look anything like an iPod, and so dilutes, rather
                      than strengthens, the iconic iPod brand. I’d like to know
                      the inside story of the design of the phone; I suspect it
                      has a lot more involvement from Motorola than Apple.

                      releases of Firefox) for a while now so I’m excited to see
                      this new release. I’m particularly enthusiastic about the
                      canvas support as I’m having fun playing around with
                      vector graphics. The Firefox canvas is much more complete,
                      though slower, than Apple’s buggy implementation in
                      Safari. The other <a

                      develop run on the general Internet. If you have a closed
                      environment they will be more useful. In such an

                      communicate between all the members of Untyped. However
                      Google has the clout to seriously challenge Skype. Two
                      important steps by Google: they are supporting the open
                      SIP protocol, and actively seeking to integrate their
                      service with other VoIP services such as <a

                      closed Skype protocol. It looks like this market is going
                      to get very interesting in a hurry. Now where are the
                      phone companies in all of this?

                      and CSS. Consider:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>When you open a slide, audio begins playing.</li>
                      <li>
                        When you switch slides, the current audio stops, and new
                        audio is started.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        I can layer objects (and remove them) over the photo
                        content quickly and easily, when and where I want them.
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                      I imagine this is all possible in JavaScript/DHTML, but… I
                      don’t know how. And, I don’t feel I need to; the
                      OpenLaszlo crew has provided a powerful platform for me to
                      work from—a compiler, GUI toolkit, RPC mechanisms, and
                      more. It seems to me that the whole JavaScript/CSS/AJAX
                      thing is nothing more but a poor reinvention of the
                      technology that OpenLaszlo provides. Granted, for full
                      RPC-functionality, OpenLaszlo currently requires a servlet
                      container, whereas AJAX-apps just need a browser with a
                      JavaScript engine. However, you don’t get much support
                      from the compiler or run-time for debugging AJAX
                      applications, whereas OpenLaszlo apps have a compiler and
                      run-time debugger. That’s worth installing a server to me.
                      (It was a double-click operation on my Mac.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If I forgo the OpenLaszlo server, I can statically compile
                      my applications; although RPC is no longer available, I
                      can still do HTTP POSTs, and that’s enough to do something
                      RESTful. But, instead of a webpage, I can create a very
                      rich, interactive GUI-based environment that can be
                      delivered to any browser that is Flash-capable. I hear
                      Macromedia has pretty good penetration, and generally
                      things Just Work within that environment, regardless of
                      whether you are on Windows or Mac, IE or Firefox, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So, I think it’s a cool technology. I’ve been poking at
                      the edges of it on-and-off for a few weeks now, and will
                      follow up with some more about what I’ve been doing with
                      it. My <a

                      as a surprise to find there is now a <a

                      The plan is pretty simple: you give them some cash, and
                      they hire a small army of Chinese people to create content
                      for your blog. It’s a bit like the old
                      monkeys-and-typewriters gag: given enough monkeys and
                      enough typewriters, eventually one of them is going to
                      produce Shakespeare. If the plan is simple the ethics are
                      substantially more murky, though in the final analysis it
                      isn’t too different to contracting out press releases to a
                      public relations firm. The difference, I think, being that
                      people have an expectation that blogs are written by those
                      personally acquainted with that which they write about.

                      cynics, liberals, outcasts, super-hip&#8221;. I’ve already
