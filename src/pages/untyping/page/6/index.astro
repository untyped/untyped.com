                      > 3 has been released. Although the interface remains
                      compatible with version 2 the underlying philosophy of
                      SchemeUnit has changed in a significant way. The following
                      is extract from the SchemeUnit manual, describing the new
                      approach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      SchemeUnit is designed to allow tests to evolve in step
                      with<br />
                      the evolution of the program under testing. SchemeUnit<br
                      />
                      scales from the unstructed checks suitable for simple<br
                      />
                      programs to the complex structure necessary for large<br
                      />
                      projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Simple programs, such as those in How to Design Programs,<br
                      />
                      are generally purely functional with no setup required to<br
                      />
                      obtain a context in which the function may operate.<br />
                      Therefore the tests for these programs are extremely simple:<br
                      />
                      the test expressions are single checks, usually for<br />
                      equality, and there are no dependencies between expressions.<br
                      />
                      For example, a HtDP student may be writing simple list<br
                      />
                      functions such as length, and the properties they are<br
                      />
                      checking are of the form:
                    </p>
                    <div>
                      <pre
                        is:raw>
(equal? (length null) 0)
(equal? (length '(a)) 1)
(equal? (length '(a b)) 2)</pre>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                      SchemeUnit directly supports this style of testing. A
                      check<br />
                      on its own is a valid test. So the above examples may be<br
                      />
                      written in SchemeUnit as:
                    </p>
                    <div>
                      <pre
                        is:raw>
(check-equal? (length null) 0)
(check-equal? (length '(a)) 1)
(check-equal? (length '(a b)) 2)</pre>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                      Simple programs now get all the benefits of SchemeUnit
                      with<br />
                      very little overhead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      There are limitations to this style of testing that more<br
                      />
                      complex programs will expose. For example, there might be<br
                      />
                      dependencies between expressions, caused by state, so that<br
                      />
                      it does not make sense to evaluate some expressions if<br
                      />
                      earlier ones have failed. This type of program needs a way<br
                      />
                      to group expressions so that a failure in one group causes<br
                      />
                      evaluation of that group to stop and immediately proceed to<br
                      />
                      the next group. In SchemeUnit all that is required is to<br
                      />
                      wrap a test-begin expression around a group of<br />
                      expressions:
                    </p>
                    <div>
                      <pre
                        is:raw>
(test-begin
(setup-some-state!)
(check-equal? (foo! 1) 'expected-value-1)
(check-equal? (foo! 2) 'expected-value-2))</pre>
                    </div>
                    <p>Now if any expression within the test-begin</p>
                    <p>
                      expression fails no further expressions in that group will<br
                      />
                      be evaluated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Notice that all the previous tests written in the simple<br
                      />
                      style are still valid. Introducing grouping is a local<br
                      />
                      change only. This is a key feature of SchemeUnit’s support<br
                      />
                      for the evolution of the program.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The programmer may wish to name a group of tests. This is<br
                      />
                      done using the test-case expression, a simple<br />
                      variant on test-begin:
                    </p>
                    <div>
                      <pre
                        is:raw>
(test-case
"The name"
... test expressions ...)</pre>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                      Most programs will stick with this style. However,<br />
                      programmers writing very complex programs may wish to<br
                      />
                      maintain separate groups of tests for different parts of the<br
                      />
                      program, or run their tests in different ways to the normal<br
                      />
                      SchemeUnit manner (for example, test results may be logged<br
                      />
                      for the purpose of improving software quality, or they may<br
                      />
                      be displayed on a website to indicate service quality). For<br
                      />
                      these programmers it is necessary to delay the execution of<br
                      />
                      tests so they can processed in the programmer’s chosen<br
                      />
                      manner. To do this, the programmer simply wraps a test-suite<br
                      />
                      around their tests:
                    </p>
                    <div>
                      <pre
                        is:raw>
(test-suite
"Suite name"
(check ...)
(test-begin ...)
(test-case ...))</pre>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                      The tests now change from expressions that are immediately<br
                      />
                      evaluated to objects that may be programmatically<br />
                      manipulated. Note again this is a local change. Tests<br
                      />
                      outside the suite continue to evaluate as before.
                    </p>

                      likely due to the influence of the SUnit testing framework,<br

                    <p>
                      I spent a good portion of last week attempting to recover
                      about 30GB of movies that had been deleted from a Mac with
                      a 60GB hard disk. When a file is deleted its normally left
                      intact on the hard disk except for a marker saying its
                      space can be reused. This means that deleted files can be
                      fairly reliably recovered, so long as the space hasn’t
                      since been used for other purposes. We found the movies
                      were missing only a few days after they were deleted, and
                      they took up half the hard disk, so I was fairly confident
                      they could be in part recovered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Of course that’s great in theory but in practice how I was
                      I going to recover those files? A quick bit of Googling
                      discovered three programs that will attempt to recover
                      deleted files on the Mac:<a href="http://www.boomdrs.com/"

                        >Data Rescue II</a
                      >. I downloaded a trial copy of each and set to work.
                      Here’s how they performed:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Boomerang ran very quickly but only found some 29MB of
                        the missing 30GB of movies. Of the three programs I
                        tested it is the easiest to use, with only a few options
                        for the most common problems. It also does a better job
                        of sticking to the Mac interface conventions than the
                        other two.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        FileSalvage took many hours to search the hard disk. It
                        found lots of files, but it didn’t identify many as
                        fragments of movies. Additionally the interface is very
                        clunky. It doesn’t use the standard Mac widgets and
                        selecting file types in Expert mode is a real pain.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Data Rescue II ran fairly quickly and found almost all
                        the lost data. Success! It is fairly easy to use. The
                        guided standard mode does a good job of leading you
                        through the recovery process, and the many options in
                        Expert mode are explained well. Like the other programs
                        it uses non-standard widgets, and this needlessly
                        detracts from its usability.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      So in my testing Data Rescue II was the clear winner.
                      Don’t read too much into this, as I was only looking for
                      movie data; one of the other programs might work better
                      for a different type of file. However, if you’ve deleted
                      some files that you want to recover I would start with
                      Data Rescue II, then try Boomerang, and only then try
                      FileSalvage (and go to bed while it’s running). Finally,
                      if you have two Macs a firewire cable and <a
                        href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1661"
                        >target disk mode</a
                      > will make the whole recovery process a bit simpler.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Now what I want to know is: why would a Mac developer
                      invent their own user interface widgets unless they really
                      want that amateur feel to their product? Is there
                      something about Cocoa programming that makes it easier to
                      create, say, your own tab component than use the system
                      one?
                    </p>

                      out. We’ve been using the pre-releases for months so this
                      release isn’t particularly significant to us. However, for
                      Universities and other institutions having an official
                      release is important. I do think that too many individual
                      developers stick with out-dated versions of PLT Scheme.
                      The number of questions about 372, which is at least a
                      year old, amazes me. Pre-releases are so much better! Go

                        corresponding business opportunity. Second interesting
                        thing is that the donation drive was <a

                        the idea of community supported social networks, but I
                        doubt it is a sustainable model. Indeed Ravelry’s
                        primary sources of income are advertising and
                        affiliation fees

                        Firstly, it takes a lot of effort to grow a community,
                        and the creators have to get involved in that early
                        stage. Later on, it’s best to get out of the way and let
                        the members decide for themselves what the community is
                        like. The discussion of Flickr’s design, intentionally
                        personal but unobtrusive, is a great point and reminds
                        me of the service at the best restaurants.

                    <p>
                      Hi Ravelry people! Thanks for dropping by and commenting.
                      It’s clear you are all very passionate, which bodes well
                      for the long-term future of Ravelry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A number of you have argued that Ravelry is more than just
                      a social network. I agree, and I think this an important
                      development in the business model for these kinds of
                      sites. Flickr was the first “social networking” site that
                      I saw that offered useful features beyond the social
                      network. This is a great model. Few people want to dive
                      into a new community without first spending some time
                      learning the rules of the group. What Flickr does is give
                      you a reason to return to the site before getting involved
                      in the social aspects. So you start of using Flickr just
                      to store your photos and then perhaps over time find your
                      way onto the various groups. In my case I never make use
                      of the social features of Flickr, but Flickr still
                      benefits from my custom. In comparison sites like
                      Friendster give you nothing to do on the site beyond the
                      social interaction, and consequentially I never visit the
                      site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Where I see Ravelry going beyond Flickr is in acting as an
                      intermediary connecting buyers and sellers in the knitting
                      and crochet community. While Flickr offers some commercial
                      services, it is a very asymmetric model with only a few
                      big sellers. It seems that Ravelry is pursuing a much more
                      egalitarian model, where any community member can easily
                      engage in either end of the transaction. Ravelry is
                      essentially the market maker, and you just have to look at
                      the London Stock Exchange or NASDAQ to see how important
                      this function is. What makes the Internet wonderful is
                      that it allows someone to make a market (and a living) in
                      something as informal and fun as knitting!

                      Then I moved to Birmingham and Scheme UK slowly died. I
                      always had the intention I’d start it up again when I had
                      more time, but now I don’t have to! Ewan Higgs has taken

                      I expect most people would say Baek. He does all the crazy
                      stuff, right? Looks hard and impressive, while Born is
                      just spinning around on the floor most of the time.
                      However, I expect most bboys would give it to Born, who in
                      fact did win that battle. Why? Born sets are well
                      constructed. He has a nice mixture of toprock (the stuff
                      standing up) and downrock (the stuff on the floor), and
                      mixes up the tempo with those pauses at 1:27 and 2:40.
                      Baek has great moves, but he just throws them down without
                      any real set up, and he messes up some of them, like the
                      hand-hop at 50s and the flares at 2:14. Also, when the
                      music changes he just wanders around the stage, not
                      dancing.

                      I like this video as its reminds me of an obvious but
                      sometimes forgotten point in software development: experts
                      are not everyone. Expert users are often the most vocal,
                      and when desiging software it can be very easy to let
                      their concerns dominate to the detriment of less skilled
                      but more numerous users. Sometimes a new feature is just <a

                      way to tell the difference is to constantly keep in mind
                      who the customer is. Startups in particular can have
                      difficulty with this, as by definition a startup doesn’t
                      yet have any customers. Common advice to startups: <a

                      our customers, and regular feedback from them is important
                      make sure we develop software that is useful for them.

                      students, but not in a context where I’ve been able to
                      really make a difference in their programming practice, so
                      I don’t have an answer to the whole question (though my
                      instinct is that the <a

                      becoming a self-directed learner. That process is <strong

                      tell the students is to<strong>ask the computer</strong

                      “the <code>string-&gt;number</code> function will convert
                      strings padded with whitespace characters to numbers”,
                      formulate the experiment<code
                        >(equal? (string-&gt;number “ 200”) 200)</code
                      >, and have as the standard of proof the boolean output of
                      this single experiment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      When most people think of the scientific method they think
                      of the lengthy and expensive double-blind trials used in,
                      for example, medical trials. A really important point is
                      to realise that when <em>you</em> do science, <strong
                        >you choose the standard of proof</strong
                      >. For example, as most computer programs are
                      deterministic a few tests can be sufficient to show a
                      property holds. When dealing with a concurrent program, or
                      some other non-deterministic system, you may need to be
                      more rigourous.
                    </p>

                      So there we have it. All programmers are scientists to
                      some extent, though they might not know it. We can extend
                      the use of experimentation to answer other questions, such
                      as determining if productivity is affected by changes to
                      software development process. Doing this in a lightweight
                      way is the intention of the <a

                      library to a really useful state. Perhaps in a later post
                      I’ll go through the ideas behind it. In the mean time, get
                      experimenting (lab coats optional).

                      Over Easter we insulated our roof. It was quite easy job,
                      but I’m not going to write much about it as this post is
                      entirely an excuse to show this picture:

                      No animal abuse was involved: he climbed up the ladder
                      into the loft and stayed there until we moved him to put
                      down more insulation.
