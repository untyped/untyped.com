                      Earlier this month Matt posted a <a
                        href="http://www.untyped.com/untyping/archives/2005/11/rich_web_client.html"
                        >provocative article</a
                      > on rich internet applications. Here’s a taster:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>
                        Ajax is a dangerous and immature technology. It is, in
                        fact, a hack—a kludget—to provide rich-client
                        functionality in the browser.
                      </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>And here’s my equally blistering riposte.</p>
                    <p>
                      Hear that sound? It’s the CEO of Oddpost, which was one of
                      the first Ajax apps, and which sold for a reported US$30
                      million to Yahoo. He’s crying himself to sleep ’cause Matt
                      said his technology sucked. My point is not (just) to
                      lampoon Matt, but to point that Ajax does work, and is
                      worth a lot of cabbages. Clearly a lot of people are using
                      it so it can’t be that hard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Matt says “Ajax (as currently exemplified by Javascript
                      and XML over HTTP) is certainly only version 0.5”. Now I
                      don’t think that is entirely fair. There a <a

                      giving that one to Matt. At least for now.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So in conclusion I argue that’s Matt case is not proved.
                      In your face Matt! Tune in next time when we kiss and make
                      up. Or Matt gives me a black eye. <img

                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I normally read 37Signal’s blog through an RSS reader, so
                      I often don’t see the comments, but what I have seen does
                      have a largely negative tone. I can understand 37Signal’s
                      reasons but it does seem that by withdrawing from the
                      conversation they’re harming their relationship with their
                      community. Now JoelOnSoftware seems to be just as popular
                      as 37Signals but doesn’t seem to have the same problem, so
                      perhaps they offer a better model. Rather than having
                      comments on each post, Joel has a number of discussion
                      boards. Blogs (or at least blog comments) aren’t the
                      greatest thing for building community as there is clearly
                      a difference in power between the blog authors and the
                      comment writers. Discussion boards are much more
                      egaliterian and hence offer less opportunity to brew
                      discontent.

                      <p>
                        A long time ago I paid a top web designer, Dave<br />

                      Authenticity is a big deal; perhaps <strong
                        >the
                      </strong>big deal for small companies. When people contact
                      a small company they want to talk to someone with a name,
                      not a random customer support droid. They want to feel a
                      personal connection to that company, and perhaps that a
                      little part of their success is due to them. Building this
                      connection is one reason we write Untyped, and also why we
                      have our
                      &lt;a href=&#8221;/about/index.php&#8221;&gt;dream
                      offices&lt;/a&gt; on our web pages. It also goes the
                      otherway: by<br />
                      personalising our web presence we feel a bit more like it’s ours.
                      In this early stage we aren’t working to build our careers,
                      we working to fulfill our passions, to build our dreams into
                      reality, and this sense of ownership is important.

                      What happens when a small company gets bigger? This
                      is were trouble hits: they
                      &lt;a href=&#8221;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_the_shark&#8221;&gt;jump
                      the shark&lt;/a&gt;. This might be the death knell for TV
                      shows, but normally companies just keep on getting bigger.
                      Except now people aren’t using their products out of any
                      attachment to the company, but because they are forced
                      to. The signs are that &lt;a
                      href=&#8221;http://www.cultureby.com/trilogy/2005/08/google_brand_an.html&#8221;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and

                      both companies we respect immensely, are tettering on the edge.

                    <p>
                      Is there anything that can be done about this? I’m
                      not sure. It’s a fact that as more people join a company
                      you can’t expect to know all of them, and vice versa. A
                      lot of companies spend a lot of money to try and project a
                      single voice, but this is really a symptom of the problem.
                      Perhaps the thing to do is let the babble overflow the
                      corporate boundaries, and let people make their own
                      connections with those inside, just like they used to? It
                      the opposite of standard marketing thinking, which is all
                      about protecting the brand, but perhaps showing the human
                      reality is the way to keep communication personal. Either
                      way, it will be a long time before we find out.

                        ‘Zimbra’s chief executive, Satish Dhamaraj, says that
                        when he started his company in December 2003, “I really
                        thought that Ajax was just a bathroom cleaner.” Now his

                        Accel partner, says Ajax “has the chance to change the
                        face of how we look at Web applications” and could boost
                        technology spending by corporations, because Ajax is
                        also being used to develop software for big companies,
                        not just for consumers.’”

                      Ajax is a dangerous and immature technology. It is, in
                      fact, a hack—a<em>kludge</em>—to provide rich-client
                      functionality in the browser.

                      While I’ll acknowledge that Javascript was intended from
                      day one for interacting with the DOM, building entire
                      applications that are predicated on dynamic, untyped
                      tree-transformations is suicide (at best) without
                      significant software development experience and rigor.
                      With that rigor, it’s just dangerous.

                      What do I mean? Pretend that every HTML element has a
                      shape. If that’s the case, then a document with a series
                      of paragraphs might look like:
                    </p>
                    <p></p>

                        hspace="8"

                    In this picture, the octagon represents the <code>body</code

                    Unfortunately, to make Ajax work, you have to constantly reorganize
                    this tree. The tree is <strong>everything</strong>: it is
                    the UI, it is the content, and it is the data for the
                    program you are writing. And, I can casually replace any one
                    node with a new node of a different type, <em>or</em> I can
                    insert whole, new subtrees.
                    <p>
                      Anywhere. Anytime. And, without any validation or safety.
                      So, I can take my first picture, and insert an entire copy
                      of it anywhere I like:
                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <center>
                      <img
                        decoding="async"
                        src="http://www.untyped.com/untyping/images/tree3.png"
                        alt="Tree3"
                        width="368"
                        height="276"
                        border="0"
                        hspace="8"
                        vspace="8"
                      />
                    </center>
                    The only problem with this is that, if the octagon is a <code
                      >body</code
                    > tag, this is<em>completely invalid HTML</em>. But that’s
                    not the worst of it; the tree representing all of my
                    interface, content, and data is a massive, and complex,
                    piece of state. So, after part of my program modifies the
                    tree, I have to forever remember that the state has changed.
                    Keeping track of state is already a dangerous part of
                    programming; it is the cause of crashes in unithreaded
                    programs (memory leaks, for example), and a source of huge
                    problems in multithreaded programs (via problems known as
                    deadlock, livelock, race hazards, etc.). This is why Google
                    Mail and other Ajax-y applications are a miracle of hackery:
                    the fact that they run, without completely buggering up
                    constantly, is a nothing short of a holy intervention on the
                    part of some higher being.
                    <p>
                      Given that the compiler does nothing to check your typing,
                      and that you have almost no run-time debugging support,
                      Ajax (as currently exemplified by Javascript and XML over
                      HTTP) is certainly only version 0.5 as tool or solution
                      for web-based development goes. Or, perhaps it is just
                      part of a space of tools, where some produce very
                      portable/accessible applications, while others allow the
                      developer to produce richer, more interesting applications
                      (while sacrificing portability).

                    It may be that Ajax is just the most portable, and least rich/safe
                    way to develop applications for end-users at the moment. Rich
                    clients, like<a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/"
                      >OpenLaszlo</a
                    >, represent a greater level of safety, as well as a much
                    richer set of tools. Widgets, like Apple’s Dashboard and <a
                      href="http://widgets.yahoo.com/">Yahoo’s Widgets</a
                    > (formerly <a href="http://www.konfabulator.com/"
                      >Konfabulator</a
                    >, an excellent, cross-platform predecessor to Apple’s
                    Dashboard) provide some of the ease of development of the
                    WWW with much of the richness of the desktop—yet there is a
                    run-time engine that provides a modicum of protection and
                    safety for the end-user. And, of course, desktop
                    applications: they sacrifice portability, but give you the
                    full power of the host machine.
                    <p>
                      I started this post with a quote about people investing
                      millions in Ajaxy technology. People investing millions in
                      Ajaxy startups scare me; they’re sheep, following the
                      herd. However, Ajax (as exemplified by Javascript and
                      HTML) will mature, and we’ll see tools and frameworks
                      develop that will make application development “safer” and
                      less hack-and-slash. Or, it will be abandoned, the <code
                        >&lt;BLINK&gt;</code
                      > tag of the new millennium.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Then again, PHP exists, and it’s a large, steaming turd of
                      a language that grabbed significant market share entirely
                      too easily. So, what can you do?

                      I went to withdraw some money from an ATM yesterday, but
                      instead of the normal screen I was confronted by a Window
                      NT 4.0 bootup screen. The machine seemed to have hung at
                      that point, so for a laugh I pressed 4-5-6, thinking it
                      was the closest key sequence to the famous <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-Alt-Delete"
                        >Ctrl-Alt-Del</a
                      >. Imagine my surprise when the machine rebooted! It can
                      tell you the ATM was a Pentium 3 running at 700MHz, with
                      128MB of RAM. This whole episode amazes me for so many
                      reasons: that ATMs run Windows (do they ever get viruses?
                      can I play Minesweeper if the network is slow?), that the
                      software doesn’t detect crashes and try to recover, and
                      that they can be rebooted so simply. I’ll never look at an
                      ATM the same way again!

                      It’s great to see industry adopting advanced programming
                      languages. Finance is not an entirely new domain for
                      functional programming. Simon Peyton-Jones wrote a <a

                      there is large literature of domain specific languages for
                      financial applications (for example <a

                        >Risla</a

                      language theory in this area.
